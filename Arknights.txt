Echoing reality
Are your memories of me?
Floating through a state
half asleep, never awake (never awake)
I won't breathe in eternity
Carrying your secrets
feeling close to who you are
You're just beyond my reach
A passing breeze
And your final moments set me free
Gentle flowing thoughts in time
Sometimes yours and sometimes mine
I can't tell where this one ends
My ever lost, forever friend
(Won't you hear my)
Echo
Reflections of my code
Sometimes I see my soul
Mirror the unknown
I knew you once were real
Your spirit theirs to steal
Conflicted, twisting consciousness I feel
Gazing through a looking glass
To a new reality (I don't know what's real)
A ribbon tied by fate leaves a trail (tie your fate to mine)
Is it peaceful, there
beyond the veil? (I don't know if I found peace)
(Won't you hear my)
Echo
(I can almost hear you speak)
Reflections of my code
(I wish you could feel me breathe)
Sometimes I see my soul
(Carry on as if you're me)
Mirror the unknown
(Take my love and plant the seed)
I knew you once were real
(I am still right here)
Your spirit theirs to steal
(Everything is dark)
Conflicted, twisting consciousness I feel
Echoes lost, and I'm still here
Sometimes fate is less than clear
Every pair of wings I clipped
was all just for the thrill of it;
the thrill of watching them go down, down.
But the taste of my own medicine
got me thinking clearly now.
It's all on me to right my wrongs.
You still think everything I touch falls to pieces?
You still think I refuse to hear the voice of reason?
I like it that way and I'm never gonna change.
She ain't ever switching, only one life that she been given.
She gon' live it, 'til the clock stop ticking, filling up every minute
with your cries for mercy, some of y'all ain't worthy of this journey.
But you ain't gotta worry, gonna get you packed up, back up outta here early,
outta site you got no vision.
Lower your voice 'fore you turn up missing.
Out here thinking you're competition but you're about to be nonexistent, listen.
They don't see her drive like car partitions.
'Til the wheels fall off we ridin' still a renegade on a mission.
I could take a step back,
could think and then act.
But I'm not gonna,
'cause it's so off-brand.
Yeah, I live for watching them go down, down.
I'm a super big fan,
my favorite track
is your SOS, (Help!)
that's my jam.
Yeah, I live for watching you go down, down, down.
I stopped asking
why I find my peace when I smash your dreams
into smithereens?
I love when everything, everything's in pieces.
I love when I refuse, I refuse to reason.
You better know that I do what it takes, do what it takes,
and I'm not gonna stop 'til
everything, everything's in pieces.
You better know that I like it that way and I'm never gonna change.
Respect her name, better learn her rep.
Better back down 'cause you're no threat.
Got a lil' somethin' to keep 'em check.
Spin 'em around like pirouettes.
Runnin' when they see her silhouette.
Ain't turned a new leaf but spring in her step.
Meet their end 'fore they see her sweat.
Funny 'cause they ain't even seen her best.
Get up and go, she ain't no quitter but known to deliver a heck of a show.
Light up the sky, she's fly, when stakes are high she's never scared to go low.
It's better you know, 'fore you go toe to toe and square up, seal your fate.
Stomach rumbling, appetite for the destruction, come on and get a plate.
I stopped asking
why I find my peace when I smash your dreams
into smithereens?
I love when everything, everything's in pieces.
I love when I refuse, I refuse to reason.
You better know that I like it that way and I'm never gonna change.
(It is what it is 'til it isn't.
Never gonna change how I'm living.)
I'm never gonna change.
(It is what it is 'til it isn't.
Never gonna change how I'm living.)
Ooh...
(Never gonna change, never gonna change, never!
Never gonna change, never gonna change, ever!)
I'm never gonna change.
(Never gonna change, never gonna change, never!)
Never gonna change.
(Never gonna change, never gonna change, ever!)
No way.
Every pair of wings I clip
is all just for the thrill of it;
the thrill of watching them go down.
What a thrill to chase survival
Reconcile, the brothers throned
Like my sons, their rule was hopeful
One undone, I left alone.
No manipulation hides it
Where my motivation lies.
(I'm a shadow)
Step inside
(I'm a shadow)
Light implied
(I'm a shadow)
Pass my test
and I promise I will care for you
and never let them rest.
I can purge, no hesitation
Intervene where debts are due
You can't have assassination
Have that cake, I'll eat it too.
No manipulation hides it
Where my motivation lies.
(I'm a shadow)
Step inside
(I'm a shadow)
Light implied
(I'm a shadow)
Pass my test
and I promise I will care for you
and never let them rest.
I can purge, no hesitation
My situation changes
You can’t have assassination
(I'm a shadow)
Step inside
(I'm a shadow)
Light implied
(I'm a shadow)
Pass my test
and I promise I will care for you
and never let them rest.
(I'm a shadow)
Clouds their eyes
(I'm a shadow)
Tensions rise,
(I'm a shadow)
One by one.
The shadow that protects you
Is erased by morning sun.
Matter change, not a gift I can claim
Never void, just a tool, and it's not mine.
Are you cold, is it ice in my soul
Or the chill from what you find? (Inside)
I don't care if the frost leads you there
It will burn, and the sear carries no shame
Status quo is a thing I don't know
I exist, a threat, the same.
Don't ask
Who would I be
Who would I be
Who would I be
Oh
Who would I be
Who would I be
If I escape the freeze?
If you melted the snow
You would still know
There is a blade, heaven made deep inside me
The hell I dispel, as your world fell
Shatters, it all comes crashing down.
You can let me be your bodyguard
I will take the blows when they come hard
I will be your wall, I'll take it all, I'll take it all
I will be the glacier that they climb
I will keep you safe and hard to find
Frozen to the ground, won't let you drown, won't let you drown
There's a shadow I can't keep at bay
In my past but I don't let it shake me
Cut the cord with the edge of my sword
But I'll never find escape
That's the key to the fortress you see
When it all knocks me down, I'm still upright
I'm the bite in the wind at your back
I'm the creature born to fight.
Don't ask
Who would I be
Who would I be
Who would I be
Oh
Who would I be
Who would I be
If I escape the freeze?
In the flurry of steel
There's a new deal
Taking the fight over flight for protection
It's a blizzard of fear, but you're safe here,
if it all comes crashing down...
You can let me be your bodyguard
I will take the blows when they come hard
I will be your wall, I'll take it all, I'll take it all
I will be the glacier that they climb
I will keep you safe and hard to find
Frozen to the ground, won't let you drown, won't let you drown
I've been a nomad,
seen most of the whole map.
Got used to drifting on my own.
Laid down my own path,
but I've always known that
I can't go at it all alone.
(Ooh-ooh...)
When the fight in me gets buried,
(Ooh-ooh...)
and my own backbone forgets me,
(Ooh-ooh...)
you would choose to still defend me
and lend me the strength we need.
We made it through Catastrophes,
through calamities;
You are all we need.
You're the cavalry.
You make it easy
to keep on believing.
You'll stick with us through thick and thin, ooh-oh...
You've been the reason
we've all kept on dreaming
like we couldn't ever be eclipsed.
(Ooh-ooh...)
When the fight in me gets buried,
(Ooh-ooh...)
and my own backbone forgets me,
(Ooh-ooh...)
you would choose to still defend me
and lend me the strength we need.
We made it through Catastrophes,
through calamities;
You are all we need. (All we need.)
You're the cavalry.
The storms we're facing,
the wars we're waging,
they don't faze me,
'cause we made it through Catastrophes,
through calamities;
You are all we need.
You're the cavalry.
Ooh, when I'm in too deep.
Ooh, and I'm out at sea.
You, you would rescue me.
You, say we'll get through this
together. (We'll get through this.)
Together.
We made it through Catastrophes,
through calamities;
You are all we need. (All we need.)
You're the cavalry.
The storms we're facing,
the wars we're waging,
they don't faze me,
'cause we made it through Catastrophes,
through calamities;
You are all we need.
You're the cavalry.
Face up to the sky
I can feel it now
I've been searching hard for a little while
Hear the sounds
Voices from the sky
Is it in my head
Telling me to fly higher up instead
Off the ground
I know there's trouble
I think that I can find my way
Beneath the rubble
Is there a flower in the grey, in the grey?
Cause sometimes i like to imagine
Sometimes I like to imagine
Sometimes I like to imagine
Sometimes I like to imagine
Is it real? I'm trying
But I feel like crying
Sometimes it just hits me
Is there something I'm missing?
And I fight my fear
But it likes to steer
From now I'm following the sun
Till I come undone
I know there's trouble
I think that I can find my way
Beneath the rubble
Is there a flower in the grey?
And though there's thunder
I'll be okay on my own
But I just wonder
Will I ever find a home, find a home?
Cause sometimes i like to imagine
Is this real?
Sometimes I like to imagine
Dancing in the grey
Sometimes I like to imagine
Is this real?
Sometimes I like to imagine
Dancing in the grey
Is this real?
I just keep dreaming
Dancing in the grey
I'm spinning
Is this real?
I just keep dreaming
Dancing in the grey
I'm spinning
Are you used to hiding your wounds?
Are you used to running from your own truth?
Are you used to thinking your secrets aren't see-through?
But how long can you last?
If you're searching for peace,
let yourself grieve.
If you yearn to be free,
just wear your heart on your sleeve.
Let your heart speak up! 
Go ahead and let it sing!
Da-da-da, da-da.
Let your heart speak up!
You can hide the cards you've been dealt,
you can go pretending you're someone else,
you can keep believing the fiction that you sell,
but how long can you last?
If you're searching for peace,
let yourself grieve.
If you yearn to be free,
just wear your heart on your sleeve.
Let your heart speak up! 
Go ahead and let it sing!
When you choose to face your true self,
she could know your pain all too well,
she could keep you neck deep in a living hell,
but if you're searching for peace...
Let your heart speak up! [×2]
Go ahead and let it sing!
Da-da-da, da-da.
Let your heart speak up!
Let your heart speak up!
Oh...
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say
and I still give my best to you.
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say.
Take your shot and I'm unfazed.
Lift this veil,
grace preserved,
nothing frail.
Don't lie to me.
Be nice to me.
Float, relaxed,
sip my wine, spill the wax.
You fear the flame,
we're not the same.
There is a labyrinth inside,
introvert but never hide.
You won't have to navigate.
I will show you if you wait.
It's a gift that you'll receive.
When you'd rather choose humble, soft and sweet,
sit next to me, you can feel me breathe...
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say
and I still give my best to you.
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say.
Take your shot and I'm unfazed.
Words are rain,
some are warm, some are pain,
they wash away your fantasy.
Yet you pretend
there are means to every end.
My dignity, just let it be.
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say
and I still give my best to you.
Say what you want,
say what you need,
mean what you say.
Take your shot and I'm unfazed.
"You and me" got added to my vocab, baby.
"You and me, you and me."
You tell me my wildest dreams ain't out of reach,
you tell me my wildest dreams are meant to be,
you make me feel lucky to be o-on the dream team.
Yeah, we're the dream team.
Spent my life stuck trekking down my own path,
didn't know that I was on the wrong track.
I was gonna do it my way as a lone wolf for life.
"You and I" got added to my vocab,
'cause of you I would never need to go back
to a time when I was destined to fly solo for life.
I was used to keeping it all to myself.
I was new to reaching out and getting help.
Now I wear your blessings like a shiny crown,
so proud to dream out loud.
You tell me my wildest dreams ain't out of reach,
you tell me my wildest dreams are meant to be,
you make me feel lucky to be o-on the dream team.
Yeah, we're the dream team.
We are gonna be bringing the heat,
gonna be causing a scene.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Anywhere we go they'll be calling us queens.
We'll forever be out of their league,
forever be out of their reach.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Anywhere we go they'll be calling us.
Queens of hearts
leaving broken pieces scattered everywhere.
Everywhere.
Queens of hearts
make them pay to taste the heartbreak in the air.
Everywhere.
I was used to keeping it all to myself.
I was new to reaching out and getting help.
Now I wear your blessings like a shiny crown,
so proud to dream out loud.
Ooh,
I dream out loud.
Ooh-woah-oh, woah-oh.
Woah-oh. 
When my doubts are creeping back in,
when it crawls down deep in my skin,
when the noise gets too loud,
your voice would say,
"You just gotta dare to dream it all!"
You tell me my wildest dreams ain't out of reach,
you tell me my wildest dreams are meant to be,
you make me feel lucky to be o-on the dream team. (On the dream team.)
Yeah, we're the dream team.
We are gonna be bringing the heat,
gonna be causing a scene.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.
Anywhere we go they'll be calling us queens.
We'll forever be out of their league,
forever be out of their reach.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.
Anywhere we go they'll be calling us queens!
Yeah.
Ooh-yeah-yeah-yeah.
Queens!
It's only ever, ever, ever been downpours, over my parades.
They wash away the stripes I fought so hard for, then they celebrate.
I had a knack for being followed by rainstorms on my sunny days.
Oh, but the new me's gonna face the music and she's gonna prove it.
I could punch a hole through the sky,
let the lightning bolts be the answer.
I'm not afraid of it, I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid of it,
let it rain down on me.
I'm not afraid of it, let it rain down on me.
I'm not afraid of it,
let it rain.
No, I don't miss the former self I abandoned, the me that held her tongue.
Now I'm commanding, taking charge like a captain, my era has begun.
Oh, I'll no longer miss a piece of that action, I'm living for the buzz.
Yeah, now the new me turns the rain to music and she's gonna prove it.
I could punch a hole through the sky,
let the lightning bolts be the answer.
I'm not afraid of it, I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid of it,
let it rain down on me.
I'm not afraid of it, let it rain down on me. [×2]
Down on me.
Let it rain down on me.
Ooh...
Let it rain down on me.
Stop the fire,
a mockingbird sings
my name, laughing, calling me.
Who's the liar?
Maybe you're in my bones, my blood.
Take it all.
Filling me up, I'm empty.
Heartbeats
counting down, if I could stop the clock, you'd win.
So, whisper the names of your enemies.
There's a darker cloud
than what you left inside,
growing like the winter wind.
I can bear your weight,
your words, and selfish pride.
You will not escape this sin.
This is my revenge,
I'll take us to the end.
You can watch beneath my skin.
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend.
I will use the burn to win.
Whispering,
falling into a sleepwalk,
pacing carefully.
I don't dream.
Closing each chapter without pain.
Silent watch.
There was a time I had a family, everything
frozen halt.
Oh, my numb epiphany.
So, whisper the names of your enemies.
There's a darker cloud
than what you left inside,
growing like the winter wind.
I can bear your weight,
your words, and selfish pride.
You will not escape this sin.
This is my revenge,
I'll take us to the end.
You can watch beneath my skin.
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend.
I will use the burn to win.
This shell, a castle.
These walls will not be scaled.
You're captured.
It's sick, how things have turned
and all the lessons learned.
Whisper the names of your enemies. 
I'm not your enemy.
There's a darker cloud
than what you left inside,
growing like the winter wind.
I can bear your weight,
your words, and selfish pride.
You will not escape this sin.
This is my revenge,
I'll take us to the end.
You can watch beneath my skin.
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend.
I will use the burn to win.
When the dusk falls,
that's when my hunch calls
out to me.
I get the inkling
with senses tingling,
telling me that we need
to step into the parts unknown and look for answers,
crack open mysterious codes to hidden chapters.
I'm grooving out to the rhythm,
the rhythm, rhythm of the mission.
Yeah, I'm coming for you.
Under cover of the night,
cruising 'cross the map, lighting fast, in the black.
Under cover of the night, I'll find
every secret that has yet to unfold!
(Every secret that has yet to unfold!)
The night will soon go,
but this still ain't no
time to sleep.
I won't be resting
until I've been through
every clue.
I'm turning every single stone under the moonlight
'cause there is no way to know what I will soon find.
I'm grooving out to the rhythm,
the rhythm, rhythm of the mission.
Yeah, I'm coming for you.
Under cover of the night,
cruising 'cross the map, lighting fast, in the black.
Under cover of the night, I'll find
every secret that has yet to unfold!
I'll find every secret that has yet to unfold!
I'm coming for you!
Yeah, I'm coming for you!
Under cover of the night,
cruising 'cross the map, lighting fast, in the black.
Under cover of the night, I'll find
every secret that has yet to unfold!
Under cover of the night!
I'll find every secret that has yet to unfold!
Under cover of the night!
Oh, yeah!
Progress only shows up as scars,
decorates me with permanent marks,
color me and turn me to art.
I'm one with the Arts.
Might take a hundred lifetimes,
but I've come to terms with the high price.
I'll carry on until I find
how to keep history from rhyming.
I hit them with my soliloquies
instead of sending out our infantries.
This could be the part of this trilogy
where I pass you the lead role.
Maybe I won't see the light of another sunrise.
Hey, there's no need to cry;
you won't be lonely cause I'll see you on the other side.
On the other side. 
Masses speaking their mind with ballads
screams a message that's louder than violence.
Follow me, let's repair the damage
instead of staying silent, ah...
It's us against the hive mind
who would rather turn a blind eye
than to recognize the righteous lives
that'll go to waste if we don't change.
The present reeks of history,
and the cynics say we're in too deep.
Who am I if I don't live to be
the one who goes down singing?
Maybe I won't see the light of another sunrise.
Hey, there's no need to cry;
you won't be lonely cause I'll see you on the other side.
On the other side. 
On the other side.
Please carry my torch and grow it into the sunrise.
No, I won't see the light of another sunrise.
Hey, there's no need to cry;
you won't be lonely cause I'll see you on the other side.
On the other side. 
On the other side.
All you would show to working men
is your crooked crescent lips.
Their limbs and their throats just hang by threads,
wrapped around your fingertips.
I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.
Oh, you trap a thousand nameless pawns
without cages, without chains.
The ones who we lost from your wars we fought
were all puppets in your game.
Ah...
(I raise my sword.)
(Harden my soul.)
Ah...
(I raise my sword.)
I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.
From the iron fists for life
is a burden we can't lift.
I once had the fight of a radiant knight
before I learned that justice may never exist.
Is it all for naught?
Is there use for fighting on?
I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.
I can feel the gears, they're turning faster,
Grinding down the only hope we have.
No one could have planned for this disaster.
But if we rise
and just open up our eyes,
the pain won't stop us from getting out (alive).
Don't think about (it).
Holding out,
the time is now or never.
We hold it all together,
we have the power to rise.
Count down the hours 'til I
crash it down just to bring it back to life.
Face to face with the machine!
This is where I'm born to be!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
You and me, we found the key
from crawling on our hands and knees!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
(Forever young and free!)
I can feel the minutes turn to hours,
reaching for the hand that holds us down.
Fear can turn you into a monster,
into a martyr,
but just remember that
if we rise
and just open up our eyes,
the pain can't stop us.
Never, not us!
Crash it down just to bring it back to life.
Face to face with the machine!
This is where I'm born to be!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
You and me, we found the key
from crawling on our hands and knees!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
Fear can turn you into a monster!
Fear can turn you into a martyr!
The time is now or never!
We hold it all together!
Fear can turn you into a monster.
But if we rise
and just open up our eyes,
the pain can't stop us.
Never, not us!
Crash it down just to bring it back to life.
Face to face with the machine!
This is where I'm born to be!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
You and me, we found the key
from crawling on our hands and knees!
Wo-oo-oo-oah! 
Forever young and free!
This is where I'm born to be!
Forever young and free!
(Forever young and free!)
Do you remember, back then?
The days of "might is right,"
the days of "thick or thin;"
the simplest of times.
Those days are far behind us;
all we know now is pain.
But I'll defend us 'til the end of our days.
(MIGHT IS RIGHT!) 'Til we crystallize.
(SACRIFICE!) Let me save one more life!
TRUST IN ME, I WILL NEVER LET YOU FALL!
(NO, WOAH!)
STAND WITH ME, AND WE WILL SAVE THEM ALL!
WOAH, WE'LL SAVE THEM ALL!!
(Mahuizzotia! Mahuizzo–)
Abandoned by my tribesmen,
won their respect back in a brawl.
Old friends turned into rivals,
but I SHOW THEM ALL!
At the heart of dust and haze, you'll find me.
Catastrophic-darkened days define me.
A SOLDIER KILLS TO SAVE A LIFE,
A DOCTOR FIGHTS FOR THE CRYSTALLIZED,
BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE ONE AND THE SAME;
WE'RE JUST A SACRIFICE!
SACRIFICE!!
With me, don't hesitate to go and give your all!
Leave all fear of pain and death behind!
TRUST IN ME, I WILL NEVER LET YOU FALL!
(NO, WOAH!)
STAND WITH ME, AND WE WILL SAVE THEM ALL!
WOAH, WE'LL SAVE THEM ALL!!
(Mahuizzotia! Mahui–)
(Mahuizzotia!)
Trust in me, I will never let you fall.
OH, TRUST ME, I WILL NEVER LET YOU FALL!
(NO, WOAH!)
STAND WITH ME, AND WE WILL SAVE THEM ALL!
WOAH, WE'LL SAVE THEM ALL!! (SAVE THEM ALL!!)
Setting fire,
fire to the night.
All of my old ways
scattered in the sky,
floating higher
and gone before my eyes.
But I'm staying steady.
Oh, I've been ready.
Yeah, I've been praying
for the rain.
Let it all start again.
I could never lose hope in you.
I'm praying for the strength,
oh, to carry the weight.
Tell me, can you feel it too?
Don't wanna do this alone.
I can feel it deep in my bones.
I can feel the ground start to shake.
I'm rising from the...
Ashes! 
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name! 
From the...
Ashes! 
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name! 
From the ashes.
Inside the damage,
can you show me I can trust you?
Cause all of the old ways are buried in the dust.
But don't you panic,
we'll always find a way out.
I would never let you down.
So tell me, will you rise up, tell me, will you stay?
When you feel the pressure underneath the weight,
oh, the weight...
I'm rising from the...
Ashes! 
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name! 
From the ashes. 
Ashes! 
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name! 
From the ashes.
Over mountains,
through rivers.
Whatever it takes to keep my head up,
it might be a bumpy ride.
There's nothing that can break my stride.
Every moment
so precious,
and it's up to me to keep a smile.
Though there's darkness all around,
there's happiness yet to be found.
My little dream is up to me.
Even if I'm on my own.
Even if I'm on my—
And one day, my dream will come true
as it's meant to.
With my positivity,
it comes together magically, they'll say.
Have you met her?
The hair trendsetter?
Feel my electricity,
I'll use my Arts for all to see!
As a waitress,
tried my hardest.
Even though I longed
to become something more.
Just guessing what's in store,
no matter what the strain,
through thunder and through rain.
Even if I'm on my— 
Even if I'm on my own.
Through these cloudy times,
allow me to be your sun. (Sun, sun.)
I'll be on your side,
working hard 'til the job gets done.
And one day, our dreams will come true
as they're meant to.
With our positivity,
it comes together magically, (magically!) they'll say!
Have you met them?
The heroes and friends?
Feel our electricity,
We'll use our Arts for all to see!
Keep the dream!
And one day, my dream will come true
as it's meant to.
With my positivity,
it comes together magically, (magically!) they'll say!
Have you met her?
The hair trendsetter?
Feel my electricity,
I'll use my Arts for all to see!
Keep the dream!
Don't hold my hand for this part.
Full speed ahead.
I know you noticed right from the start.
Had my head held high since it began.
Cause I've laid it out for them.
Just tell me could you get up
in the aftermath? Oh,
would you leave it all
out on the table now
before the dust settles down?
Cause right before the sunrise,
I can see the fear in your eyes.
(Cause) you thought I'd disappear for good now.
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again, think again, ah...
You thought that I was gone for good now.
Praying I'd turn around instead, hey, hey, hey!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again.
Full speed ahead. 
It's you and me,
we're going in,
we're going head to head.
I'm coming at you like a bull,
all I see is red.
A fire in my righteous eyes,
you can't hide.
Cause I'm the light illuminating every shadow, oh!
I'm coming for you,
I can see it that you're running low
cause I've been reading the signs.
I feed the fear in your mind.
(Cause) you thought I'd disappear for good now.
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again, think again, ah...
You thought that I was gone for good now.
Praying I'd turn around instead, hey, hey, hey!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again.
Full speed ahead. 
So listen up,
I've got the holy light
at my command.
And I've got trouble here for you
in my right hand.
Cause you've been left now open wide,
so justified.
I won't let the people down,
gonna raise them high,
We're getting louder everyday,
yeah, we're amplified.
Stunning with the light,
you're gonna want to be on my side.
Ah...
It's over...
Ah...!
It's over...!
Cause I'm comin',
I'm coming for you.
Yeah, you know it's full speed ahead.
(Cause) you thought I'd disappear for good now.
You thought you left me here for dead, dead, dead, dead!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again, think again, ah...
You thought that I was gone for good now.
Praying I'd turn around instead, hey, hey, hey!
You thought that I'd be slowing down by now,
but think again.
Full speed ahead.
Bow to the wind.
Feel her vestments,
Heal my skin.
The blind bargain's thin.
She's no stranger to rushing in.
Mission sub rosa,[note 1]
Concealed en umbra.[note 2]
Throwing caution to the wind.
She'll risk it for the lives.
She's left behind.
Hope's alive,
But she's flying blind.
Capricious at a moment's notice,
You ready?
Staging through time,
On her thread she'll save us nigh.
Her mind is confound,
She's no stranger to method sound.
Mission sub rosa,[note 1]
Concealed en umbra.[note 2]
Throwing caution to the wind.
She'll risk it for all the lives.
That she's left behind.
Hope's on the rise,
But she's flying blind.
Standing eclipse.
Feel the fire on her skin.
This blind bargain's thin.
She's no stranger to rushing in.
Mission sub rosa,[note 1]
Concealed en umbra.[note 2]
Throwing caution to the wind.
She'll risk it for the lives.
She's left behind.
Hope's on the rise,
But she's flying blind.
You're unsatisfied with your life.
You feel anxious about everything.
You don't know how to live as you like.
Dragging your body, day out and day in.
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oh. 
Take a deep breath, close your eyes.
Why not have a daydream?
P-Pick a cloud,
Carry you to the far, far sky.
Hey, just chill out, a tipsy smile.
One day,
You'll find the tune for your own song.
Day, daydream.
Drink, drank, drunk.
Day, daydream.
Sing, sang, song.
You're unsatisfied with your life.
But you know that you will fit right in.
Nothing can stop you to live as you like.
Keep going and enjoy, day out and day in.
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oh. 
Take a deep breath, close your eyes.
Why not have a daydream?
P-Pick a cloud,
Carry you to the far, far sky.
Hey, just chill out, a tipsy smile.
One day,
You'll find the tune for your own song.
Day, daydream.
Sing, sang, song.
Day, daydream.
Drink, drank, drunk.
Day, daydream.
Sing, sang, song.
Ha-ha-ha. 
You'll see,
I'm sick and tired of saying "pretty please"!
No more begging on my knees!
You're gonna see a different side in me,
When you come out of hiding!
(Alive!)
I feel so... (Alive!)
Alive! (Alive until sunset!)
Tell me what you're waiting for,
'Cause I'm here to even out the score!
It's true,
It didn't even hurt to play with my heart,
You killed our story!
It's true,
I'm not the timid girl you thought you knew!
Baby, why you look so blue?
I will not bend because you want me to!
Come out, come out! I'll show you!
(Alive!)
I feel so... (Alive!)
Alive! (Alive until sunset!)
I've heard the way that you've been talking about me,
It's not so nice to bend my words as you please,
My armor's stronger, now you're not getting in,
The fire in my heart is burning to win,
So come on!
Tell me what you're waiting for,
'Cause I'm here to even out the score!
It's true,
It didn't even hurt to play with my heart,
You killed our story!
Tell me what you're waiting for,
'Cause I'm here to even out the score,
With you!
Because I finally found the strength in my heart! (Strength in my heart!)
Tell me what you're waiting for,
'Cause I'm here to even out the score!
It's true,
It didn't even hurt to play with my heart,
You killed our story!
Yeah,
She's a mercenary.
You can't ride with her unless you're revolutionary,
And to get it she gon' do whatever's necessary.
Make a victim, break the system, some results may vary.
Situations scary but she's never worried.
Picture that, even when it's bad she still get the bag.
Fightin' thru the dark to find her light so she can get it back.
Strugglin' within, do what's right or live life of sin.
Try and try again! Is she bound to meet a violent end?
Don't think twice, better be brave.
Like a soldier, do what I told ya.
Lived my life, a renegade.
I gotta warn ya, I gotta warn ya!
The only thing that you gotta know,
Is that I do what it takes, do what it takes!
Gotta bring 'em down to take control,
I'm gonna do what it takes, do what it takes!
I make you believe that the choice is yours,
But I'm changing sides, now the roles reversed!
The only thing that you gotta know,
Is that I do what it takes, do what it takes!
I'm a renegade – I'm a, I'm a renegade! 
I'm a bad girl, Im'ma pull your strings. (Yeah!)
You gonna make your moves, but I control your whole team. (Yeah!)
Nobody here is going toe to toe with me, (Yeah!)
Everything you thought you knew is what I made you think. (Uh-huh,)
I know how to get what I want,
Do what it takes to step to the top,
Gonna bait, manipulate to run the game's fate,
No stalemate, you're dead weight.
Watch me ignite grenade gone wild.
Im'ma blow up, y' can't cop my style.
Born to lead, y' can't stop my mercs.
When you hear my sound y' better hit the dirt.
Don't think twice, better be brave.
Like a soldier, do what I told ya.
Lived my life, a renegade.
I gotta warn ya, I gotta warn ya!

But I'm changing sides, now the roles reversed!
The only thing that you gotta know,
Is that I do what it takes, I do what it takes!
Yeah, y'all don't really know who you playin' wit'.
Let me talk to em:
Playing both sides like she player one and two but she playing you.
Playing her, that's a fatal move. You must play to lose.
Serve herself is what she came to do. 'Til she say "adieu".
Test her then you best prepare to meet the one you prayin to.
So stay on her good side, if you wanna live in a world that she planning to change.
Even with the good guys, she still a badass no matter the side that she claim.
Gotta be ice in her veins cuz she gonna get it no matter the price or the pain.
That's just a part of the game. Playing for keeps. Are you not entertained?
The only thing that you gotta know,
Is that I do what it takes, do what it takes! (Do what it takes!)
Gotta bring 'em down to take control,
I'm gonna do what it takes, do what it takes!
I make you believe that the choice is yours, (The choice is yours!)

(Wo-oah!)
We're not gonna lose! (Not gonna lose!)
We're not gonna give up this fight!
(Not gonna get us, get us! They're not gonna get us, get us!)
We've (got) nothing to lose! (Nothing to lose!)
I know it all ends here tonight! (Tonight!)

(Wo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oah!)
We'll fight until the world ends!
We won't be fated to pretend!
We won't give up– no, not again! (No, not again!)
Now all the world is here to see,
Just how much faith you put in me!
Our love is ash and memory! (Ash and memory!)
(Wo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oah!)
They don't really want no smoke with my collective,
Gotta respect it. Fight to protect it.
You can't find an L on my record, better accept that. (I'm a King.)
You all talking without the action! You show-offs in need some practice!
We go hard, we making it happen, ain't no cappin'! (Do your thing!)
Better applaud, when I go off, let me (show you how it get done!)
No matter the odds, take out a squad, you can't (beat me one against one)
Once you see me, (all y'all are done,) crush your ego, (do it for fun!)
That's for anybody, getting rowdy, (time to pack up and run!) Uh!
Hey, 'ey, put me on blast,
Ready for attack, I be like that.
Say, hey, what you gonna do?
I already know.
'Cause we're the best around!
Get you with the left, right,
Back it up.
Yeah, my crew's air-tight.
We're unstoppable!
Yeah, you know!
'Cause we're the best around!
I'm coming up the back line,
Pass you up.
Careful, cause I might bite.
We're unstoppable!
Yeah, you know!
We're the best around!
You know, we're breakin' the mold.
Winning? It never gets old.
They all be diggin my style,
Lookin all wild,
Make 'em go "whoa!"
All of my haters, go check it.
When I hit the scene, I go wreck it.
It's time for the fight, so go choose.
We never lose!
Hah! Who knew Indra be climbing the ranks?
Not a cub, but a full-grown tiger.
It's a good look, don't you think?
Riding high, don't you admire?
Growin up on the streets, 're rough.
Glasgow Gang's what made me tough.
Taking risks, throwing fists,
I'll put you in your place,
If you're in my face.
Like what?
Hey, 'ey, put me on blast,
Ready for attack, I be like that.
Say, hey, what you gonna do?

Pass you up.
Careful, cause I might bite.
We're unstoppable!
Yeah, you know!
We're the best around!
They call me Siege.
Yeah, I got all eyes on me.
I'm born to lead,
No, you will never stop me!
I make the rules, yeah, I pave my own path.
Nah, I don't need you, cause you know I strike back.
Cause I'm on fire.
Catch me like a fast car,
I'm independent, I be, I be spendin',
Yeah, I'm a warrior,
And I'm coming for you.
So whatcha gonna do?
I am a specialist, cross my targets,
Off of my list with the flick of the wrist,
Call it a trick, wind it up, bringing it back.
Sorry for spoiling your plans.
Total domination, Rhodes Island.
We ain't playing, was that your best move?
Tell me that ain't true, this is too easy, (this too easy!)
I'm in my habitat,
Put me in anywhere, (anywhere,) I can adapt.
Once you are caught in my strings, (Haha!)
Nowhere to run, you're stuck in my trap.
When they call Ethan, they looking to hunt.
Solve the impossible, after I stunt.
Living it up, my crew doing damage.
No need to boast, but we do the most.
Hey, 'ey, put me on blast,
Ready for attack, I be like that.

I wanna feel that summer breeze across my neck,
I, I, I wanna, 
Trying to leave the past behind and just forget,
I, I, I gotta, 
I, I, I wanna be in this moment,
But my heart is saying something is missing.
I, I, I gotta follow and listen,
And listen.
I'm ready to begin,
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings,
and fly over everything.
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
I know I'm powerful.
I don't care if I fall,
'Cause I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
I'm not the girl I used to think I had to be.
I, I, I'm loving this new, new vision,
Discovering a deeper meaning within me.
I, I, I'm loving this way I'm paving.
I, I, I wanna be in this moment,
But my heart is saying something is missing.
I, I, I gotta follow and listen,
And listen.
I'm ready to begin,
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings,
and fly over everything.
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
I know I'm powerful.
I don't care if I fall,
'Cause I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
Spread my wings!
I just wanna,
Spread my wings!
I wanna,
Spread my wings!
I wanna,
Spread my wings and fly!
I'm ready to begin,
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings,
and fly over everything.
I can do anything.
I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
I know I'm powerful.
I don't care if I fall,
'Cause I just need the wind to carry me,
While I spread my wings.
Where the spring mists settle
as the valleys breathe,
And the hillock's shadow light and calm.
You're naught to feel unwanted
though the world might abhor,
Your home is in Victoria, Victoria... once more.
When the night wind calls us
to the tussling fields,
Lost in battle, weary in your heart.
I'll uphold her honor
as we march to the shore.
And I will see
Victoria, Victoria, once more.
My heart will sing Victoria, Victoria... once more.
Her light, a harbor for faithless.
She won't let you fall.
When the darkness calls you,
Anchor safe in her walls.
Like a shield, she's Victoria.
Her love for you is an army.
Protected and served.
When you're lost, unwanted,
She's your hope, preserved.
Like a sword, she's Victoria.
Even if I wander
yon' the hills towards Sargon,
She'll keep calling
and her beacon lead
like a warship steady through the storm.
I am left unshaken, I'm safe in her arms.
The solace of Victoria.
Hopeful in Victoria.
My heart will sing Victoria.
March past the dusty moors,
Shake off a thousand wars,
Leaving, not left alone.
Victoria is our home...
You're naught to feel unwanted
though the world might abhor.
Your home is in Victoria... once more...
Not a choice.
It's a call, pay the price.
Stay the course, sacrifice.
Trade pain for safety.
For Kjerag.
There's a plan
for the future, it's told.
It's a path, walk it bold
through history, sorrowful.
Guiding light
sometimes burns.
Guiding light.
Holding the line
steady, moving on.
All stars aligned,
the foundation safe and strong.
Throw every stone,
shatter every wall.
Earthquake and storm,
you will never see them fall.
All once known is lost.
Intentions are revealed
with time, revenge, at cost.
Broken wings are healed.
Be a saint.
Be a voice for the tribes.
Calculate, through the strife.
Don't drift, don't waver.
Bring the strength,
bring the hope to survive.
Understand that in time
hearts heal, not falter.
Guiding light
will unchanged.
Guiding light.
Holding the line
steady, moving on.
All stars aligned,
the foundation safe and strong.
Throw every stone,
shatter every wall.
Earthquake and storm,
you will never see them fall.
Burdens
cloaked in armor.
A heart's protection.
A true love's savior.
Boardwalk, breezy, half a daze;
Summer.
Ice cream, pizza, lemonade;
Summer.
Drifting, scattered thoughts and clouds;
Summer.
Saying what you feel out loud,
that's summer.
June gloom followed winter blues,
now oceanside and sandy shoes,
We don't have a thing to do.
Ditch your clothes, jump in the—
Take your cares and turn them loose.
Waves crash turning misty,
salt brushes my lips.
Stop talking and kiss me,
It's a summer hit.
Skyline hot and hazy
full of hot air balloons,
coastline in the summer,
it feels like you.
This is how we do it right—
Waves crash turning misty,
salt brushes my lips.
Stop talking and kiss me,
It's a summer hit.
Skyline hot and hazy
full of hot air balloons,
coastline in the summer,
it feels like you. 
With the will of iron cast in flames,
let's bring glory to our names!
Follow me, brave champions of Victoria, once again!
All together, we march on!
Strike! Fight! Charge ahead!
Show no fear or dread!
For Victoria!
We will march on!
Unafraid, unbroken, we will fight!
Let your countless voices fill the night!
Follow me, and prove all evil crumbles before our might!
As together we march on to our song!
I was captive, lost, alone.
But my army's only grown.
For our love, our light, our home,
we cry: "March on!"
Strike! Fight! Charge ahead!
Show no fear or dread!
For Victoria! We will march!
Even as they chained me down,
it was then my strength was found.
And with soldiers, comrades, friends,
I'm calling: "March on!"
Strike! Fight! Charge ahead!
Show no fear or dread!
For Victoria!
We will march on!
Strike! Fight! Charge ahead! (Raise your voices to the sky!)
Show no fear or dread! (Roar our battle cry!)
For Victoria! (Our victory is nigh!)
We will march on! (March on! March on!)
She's sitting by the window,
drawing on the foggy glass.
She's walking down the alley,
shaping the snow on (the) ground.
Something slipped away
before I learn to hold in hand.
Talking in the sleep,
Having a cup of coffee[note 4],
sugar melts away.
Something left a mark
before I realize how it hurts.
Turn back the hands of time,
Something slipped away,
there is not a trail to find.
Something left a mark
like an anchor hooked in mind.
She's sitting by the window,
alone and all alone.
I am the one, a lost boat in the ocean
trying to find a shore, to breathe, to begin.
Moonlight fills the emptiness in the night.
Only see those waves, echoing in the tide.
Stand on the broken deck,
listen to the loneliness,
feel the stormy rain start to breed,
Let it come, let it come, let it come.
Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in the sea.
The rain is pouring, the ocean's crumbling,
you're the only thing I can see.
Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in my heart.
Break through the night,
so strong and bright,
you are my lighthouse.
I am the one, a lost boat in the ocean.
(In the ocean.)
Only Heaven knows the blue of the sea.
(Blue of the sea.)
Moonlight fills the emptiness in the night.
Only see those waves echoing in the tide.
Stand on the broken deck,
listen to the loneliness.
The stormy rain starts to breed,
let it come, let it come, let it come.
Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in the sea.
The rain is pouring, the ocean's crumbling,
you're the only thing I can see.
Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in my heart.
Break through the night,
so strong and bright,
you are my lighthouse.
You are my lighthouse.
I spent my life suffocating,
ignoring villains living inside me.
Oh, my guilt is never-fading.
It forever lives on
under my skin,
killing me from within.
Will you stay a part of me for the rest of my life?
You tighten your grip
like shackles on both my wrists.
Will you stay a part of me for the rest of my life?
I once was a dreamer,
but then I grew up and saw the real world.
When I look in the mirror,
I can almost see you crawling
under my skin,
killing me from within.
Will you stay a part of me for the rest of my life?
I bit my tongue for years.
I choked back every tear.
I carry you all on my own
'cause you insist you only feel at home.
Under my skin,
you're killing me from within.
Will you stay a part of me for the rest of my life?
Weigh the pros and cons on cross road.
Hesitating.
If I can take everything into account accurately,
will I get to the place marked by map?
Hesitating.
Calculating.
Hesitating.
Wrong formula!
Life is like a dice game;
whatever will be, will be.
You want to be definite,
I want to be infinite.
Cast the dice. Round and round,
never stop—
randomly.
So silent, the empty pathway.
Hesitating.
If I follow my heart all the way,
will I get to the place I'm longing for?
Space-time is like a riddle game.
Does God play dice?
You say it will be definite,
I say the world is infinite.
Set out. Round and round,
never stop—
random, randomly.
Throw the dice into the air, and watch it falling down.
A superposition state of infinite possibilities.
Life is like a dice game;
whatever will be, will be.
Be brave, be different;
no one can make definition of you.
Set out. Place to place,
never stop—
random, randomly.
Through the thunder, on the wind.
Baby wolf all in a spin
to run, run, run away from here.
Run, run, run away from here.
And you fight back through the rain.
A struggle, hide the pain.
Run, run, run, you're pushing through.
Run, run, run away from you.
Softness is fields of surrender
under the stars, through the hills, over walls.
Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart in a tiny cage.
A place she's never been,
where it's safe to start again.
Run, run, run, it's not so far.
Run, run, run from where we are.
It's a promise, cross the moors,
hunting what you know is yours.
Run, run, run, it's yours to make.
Run, run, run, it's yours to break.
Strength is the nothing you left there.
Carry the sun on your back, start again.
Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart in a tiny cage.
If this was forever,
you'd sever the tether.
We'd cherish the wilds and explore
from forest to ocean.
Our plan is in motion,
becoming who we really are.
We rule through broken hearts.
Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart in a tiny cage.
Flashback of the memory that
show up in my dream.
I wake up at midnight and tears are fallin'.
I was trying to reach out for somebody.
I was hiding till you wrap your arms around me.
I drew a picture of you I used to know.
Still don't recall the color of curtains on the window.
Remember looking down for the missing piece of stone.
But I can see it clear now,
I'm writing my way.
Every time with the season
I change and I'm turning.
Every night has a reason,
I promise you sunrise.
But stand up, no going back.
Everyday I try finding
the light of your star.
Flashback of the memory how
young 22 with you.
So much to carry through, I used to fall for the night.
I cried till I lost myself in the sea.
Side by side, you had gone right before me.
The colors of the rainbow never in the row.
At spring the flowers blooming (and) summer came in blue.
No control of time, but still wanna follow you,
keep walking up the mountains, I'm riding my way.
Every time with the season
I change and I'm turning.
Every night has a reason,
I promise you sunrise.
But stand up, no going back.
Everyday I try finding
the light of your star.
Every time with the season
I'm ready to start.
I'm looking up for you.
Every night has a reason.
Stand up, no going back.
I'm searching for a sign of you...!
Every time with the season
I change and I'm turning.
Every night has a reason,
I promise you sunrise.
But stand up, no going back.
Everyday I try finding
the light of your star.
When the sun fades out of sight,
constellations come to life,
the serotonin keeps us floating,
we contemplate our lives.
To the numbers, safe and sound,
my hypotheses abound.
I've got a theory,
you're there with me,
transcending data found.
Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.
Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I
live fully.
If patterns prove us right,
more than particles and light,
it's (a) simple science,
full compliance,
it keeps me up at night.
Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.
Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I—
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la.
—live fully.
Life is a gift to me, I'm here for it.
Like a smile at a party, I swoon,
measure time by the moon.
Is it over too soon?
Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.
Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I—
There's a threshold you cross
when the book
starts to turn.
It's a rook
cheating your present of peace.
Stories rewrite,
stars flee the night.
Judging the cover by look.
There's a dusty old line
in the sand
blown to bits
by my past,
no longer tempting the muse.
People can change...
...a promise I made.
Flight over fight, I'll refuse.
Give and take
the ties that you break.
Why, you can't say.
You don't think that way.
Come and go,
no longer abide.
Blood on your hands won't do.
Judge not, the thorns in you.
At the end of the road
in the dark,
lies in wait
like a shark.
Teasing temptation and greed,
narrow my focus,
staying my course
not for lust, only to feed.
Give and take
the ties that you break.
Why, you can't say.
You don't think that way.
Come and go,
no longer abide.
Blood on your hands won't do.
Judge not, the thorns in you.
I couldn't follow our distorted old rubric.
I tried so hard to be the one who improves it,
but the harder I fought, the worse we got.
I got lost and I let my morals get diluted.
A gavel strike can end a life,
but still my gavel falls like endless cannonballs.
The sounds echo back and haunt my dreams.
They're taunting me, telling me that I'm the one who will be sentenced,
sentenced today.
How did my own code get so fragile and fluid?
Isn't it obvious that my conscience has bruises?
I just wanna come clean, don't you see?
My hands are tied by an institution in ruins.
All the weight on my shoulder
replaced by monsters.
The face in the mirror,
I barely know her.
I became a foot soldier who swings for the ones that hold power.
A gavel strike can end a life,
but still my gavel falls like endless cannonballs.
The sounds echo back and haunt my dreams.
They're taunting me, telling me that I'm the one who will be sentenced.
Sentenced to a lifetime of nightmares.
(Oo-oh, oo-oh.)
(Oo-oh, oo-oh.)
In another life,
I would pay the price
of a million crimes
until the end of time.
Winding roads by way of selfless means.
Free hearts are never broken.
Keep your monsters, 'cuz my banner's clean.
Truer words have never been spoken.
It's a cut above the life you lead.
All the risk was worth the gamble.
Like a wolf, I hunt down what we need.
Crumbled walls and empty castles.
Been a long time, been a long time on my own.
Breaking the family ties to build a home.
We ride, calm and cool.
Play the fool when kings all lie.
We ride, for the peace
that we've killed to bring to life.
We ride, on a chance
that things will finally go my way.
We ride for a new flag,
with no guarantee.
Winding roads can lead your path astray.
Don't walk with waning motive.
They'll push no matter what you say.
Keep your dragons locked and loaded.
Been a long time, been a long time on my own.
Breaking the family ties to build a home.
We ride, calm and cool.
Play the fool when kings all lie.
We ride, for the peace
that we've killed to bring to life.
We ride, on a chance
that things will finally go my way.
We ride for a new flag,
with no guarantee.
When you speak, it sounds like the sweetest melody.
Gets my heart all fuzzy, just like a bumblebee.
What a dream it is to be in your company,
it's a fairytale I hope I never have to leave.
The autumn leaves may fall away,
but my memories will forever stay.
Gold like my afterglow. 
It mirrors your candlelight eyes,
lights up our nectarine skies.
You glow like your heart of gold,
you glow from your head to toe,
you glow with a marigold hue,
you glow like the sky on a harvest moon.
When you tell me, "Look, now the skies are tangerine!"
My eyes are glued to you instead, you're enchanting me.
When you catch me staring you smile from cheek to cheek,
it's a fairytale I hope will last like evergreens.
Soon we may see falling snow, but,
I could never feel the cold, 'cause when I'm with you I feel–
Gold like my afterglow. 
It mirrors your candlelight eyes,
lights up our nectarine skies.
You glow like your heart of gold,
you glow from your head to toe,
you glow with a marigold hue,
you glow like the sky on a harvest moon.
Gold like my afterglow. 
It mirrors your candlelight eyes,
lights up our nectarine skies.
You glow like your heart of gold,
you glow from your head to toe,
you glow with a marigold hue,
you glow like the sky on a harvest moon.
Gold like my afterglow. 
I'm living the dream in paradise.
Long as I have you by my side,
you glow like your heart of gold,
you glow from your head to toe,
you glow with a marigold hue,
you glow like the sky on a harvest moon.
Don't let the loneliness stop you
from being kind.
Don't let them say that your peace is a
waste of time.
Don't let them crush all your dreams, then
change their mind
This room was built for one chair only.
I'm not empty, I'm just lonely,
tied to the ghost of you.
I can be gentle too.
Just one look and I'm less reclusive.
Slurring words, we speak in cursive.
It's just a passing phase,
I whisper as you fade.
Oh-ooh... letting me go isn't the only answer.
Oh-ooh... letting me go makes the world spin faster.
"No one like me" doesn't mean you won't like me.
Oh-ooh... I'll let you go,
it's a pattern on repeat.
Don't let utopia haunt you,
there's more to save.
Don't stop the search for the perfect,
you're smart and brave.
Don't let them sail off in anger,
just smile and wave.
The ship takes off, now I'm the captain.
Gentle breeze, I'll make it happen.
I'm gonna lock the doors,
no one allowed on board.
I won't choose, I'm not ungrateful;
making peace to quell the hateful.
Look at the mess you made.
I whisper as you fade.
Oh-ooh... letting me go isn't the only answer.
Oh-ooh... letting me go makes the world spin faster.
"No one like me" doesn't mean you won't like me.
Oh-ooh... I'll let you go,
it's a pattern on repeat.
I'd like some information, please.
Define the weakness of your enemies.
From the shadows, I can mark the breaks
and take your failures as a front row seat to watch your knees shake, shake.
I'll have my premonition, please.
Your information doesn't mean a thing to me.
I see the holes in your logic and a picture in your locket;
it's the people you don't wanna leave.
I'll give you thirty seconds headstart
to state your case before a biased court.
When your sentence is delivered, I won't like it,
but in silence I'll accept what I've been trained for.
It's no catastrophe
when you run from me;
all the rumors that surround you simply atrophy.
It don't matter how dark,
I feel the heat in your heart
and it's screaming like a beacon, now you're on my radar.
I've spelled it out in ways you understand.
I'll simply simplify my master plan.
Talking to myself,
spinning shadows into spells
is the surest way to make it land.
You can keep your dirty devil's war.
It's a rotten apple, poisoned core.
But if they call me to the line, it's gonna be a
break in silence and you'll know what I'm there for.
It's no catastrophe
when you run from me;
all the rumors that surround you simply atrophy.
It don't matter how dark,
I feel the heat in your heart
and it's screaming like a beacon, now you're on my radar.
It's no catastrophe
when you run from me;
all the rumors that surround you simply atrophy.
It don't matter how dark,
I feel the heat in your heart
and it's screaming like a beacon, now you're on my radar.
Snowy white,
warm and toasty 'cuz its Christmas time.
Come inside,
light the fire, because its Christmas time.
All the joy togetherness brings,
we forget the world, we laugh, and drink and sing.
Stay a while, Christmas makes me smile.
Silver bells,
cozy blankets sparkly Christmas trees.
Stockings hung,
baking treats, it means so much to see.
Stop the world a moment for me.
Let me live inside the snowglobe of my dreams.
Stay and play, Christmas is today!
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
the world all a glow.
We wish you a Merry Christmas
when your warm heart melts the snow!
When Christmas fades,
we will have the joy and memories we made!
Hold them dear, so
Christmas lasts all year!
Dashing through the snow.
Every schemer in the shadows
will be greeted by the barrel.
The Law is just, like my ammo,
seeking out the ones needing just a touch more faith.
When we fall from grace,
we are all the same.
When you fall from grace,
all our souls are stained.
If you lose faith in your own home
and you feel like you might grow horns,
The Law will come smite the wrongs you've done.
There's no point trying to run, trying to run from a fully loaded.
When we fall from grace,
we are all the same.
When you fall from grace,
all our souls are stained.
It's a long way down for the fallen.
It's a long way down–
where are you going?
When we fall from grace,
we are all the same.
When you fall from grace,
all our souls are stained.
Soul stained.
Said goodbye to the bruises on my surface
But my mind would insist I'm not done hurting
Deep inside hiding far behind my curtains
Are wars no one knows I'm still fighting
When the nightmares come flooding back
You'd be right there to hold my hand
And just make it all OK
I wish that everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me
It melts the gloom away
If someday everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me
Then maybe
We'll all be OK
In a way I'm still a broken shell of a person
Still you stay, and say I'll never be a burden
Heaven's sake, you could put up with any version of me
My beauty that you speak of
I could only ever dream of
Heaven's sake, how is it possible every version of you
Is too good to be true?
(True)
When the nightmares come flooding back (Flooding back)
You'd be right there to hold my hand (Hold my hand)
And just make it all OK
I wish that everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me
It melts the gloom away
If someday everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me
Then maybe (maybe)
We'll all be OK
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
We'll all be OK
Ooh
Ooh (We'll be OK)
Ooh
We'll all be OK
If you feel I'm holding you back
I would understand it
And if you need to say your goodbyes
I would understand it
So many more out there deserve you too
(They deserve you)
Deserve you too
(They deserve you)
I wish that everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me (I wish)
It melts the gloom away (Let it melt away)
If someday everyone I love could feel the way that you embrace me (I wish)
Then maybe (maybe)
We'll all be OK
Ooh (We'll be OK)
Ooh (We'll be OK)
Ooh
We'll all be OK
Ooh (We'll be OK)
Ooh (We'll be OK)
We'll all be OK
Waiting by the window to revel in the last light of day.
Hoping that these empty halls are here to guide my way.
Trying to find–
To find the cure, I toil
long after the setting sun.
Endeavoring to show them all.
To heal the damage done.
All that I strive for.
The oath I swore.
And yet this malady wears on.
Forever they fall...
And as the day wains,{{Sic
I feel your pain.
But there's more yet to ascertain.
Dedicated to this research, trials that keep me hidden away.
Medicinally minded, I'll keep your aches at bay.
Silent, I'll mend.
Soothe your hurt
in an ascetic sacrifice.
I try
to keep you alive.
All that I strive for.
The oath I swore.
And yet this malady plagues on.
Forever we fall...
And as the day wains,[sic]
I feel your pain.
I pray my efforts aren't in vain,
should ever you fall.
We’re standing on a tight rope
Balancing in sync
Snacking while we study, sipping on a drink
Everything is jumbled in my mind
Oh!
Distracted when you text me,
Swiping through some posts,
Dreaming of a date night, and organizing notes
Focusing to see the other side,
Oh!
Even if the sky is gray, you’re sunny
Always finding time for play, it’s funny,
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
We can make the most of every moment,
Playing safe or making trouble, own it
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
Breezy by the seaside, misty on my face
We don’t have to rush it, we don’t gotta race,
Leave it to the classroom it can wait, whoa,
This is what we worked for, it’s our time,
Now we have the summer, the stars will shine
Everyday a weekend, make it mine
Even if the sky is gray, you’re sunny
Always finding time for play, it’s funny,
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
We can make the most of every moment,
Playing safe or making trouble, own it
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
I had a dream that we were free
To be whatever we want to be
Whenever we’re stuck inside,
We can’t wait for the summertime
I had a moment it was lost,
I’d get it back at any cost
Let worry go, and let’s unwind,
Find ourselves in summertime
Even if the sky is gray, you’re sunny
Always finding time for play, it’s funny,
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
We can make the most of every moment,
Playing safe or making trouble, own it
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with
Even if the sky is gray, you’re sunny
Always finding time for play, it’s funny,
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
We can make the most of every moment,
Playing safe or making trouble, own it
Popsicles and worries melt when I’m with you
In shallow water I saw reflections.
Upon the sweetest dreams
you still with me.
In deep hollow I wrote my fictions.
Sure it was a lie.
Lying to believe.
Trying to conceit.
Embrace me!
Heaven help us from this fall!
Blasphemy!
Faith and hope can burn and die!
It's creeping under the darkest shadows.
It's shining in the blinding lights.
Where do we find the absolution?
All the promises you've made,
they are too much to conceive.
Embrace me!
Heaven help us from this fall!
Concealed to me,
hellish silence shows it all!
Leave me.
Embrace me.
Leave me.
Embrace me, EMBRACE ME!
Leave me
in the hollow we are hiding!
Embrace me!
Just see for yourself!
Leave me
in the shallow we are waiting!
Embrace me!
RELEASE ME!!
Simple, solemn tone
in my words and shattered bone.
Am I talking to myself,
Who's in control?
Guarding those long gone,
With a haunting, simple song.
Rising waves of bodies save
the world from all you've wronged,
I can feel the fog.
Leave behind your dead. (Intoxicating)
I will make them mine. (Intoxicating)
They animate. (Intoxicating)
You rot in time. (Intoxicating)
Plans set in motion,
Scent of devotion.
Oh, the dark rise
Oh, in your eyes.
Intoxicating
Intoxicating
Take responsibility,
Souls, adrift, that long to be.
Penned, I write their destiny
Like my mother, before me.
Hear the whistle sound,
Calling those below the ground.
Defending with my life, the once divine,
Now lost in sands of time.
Leave behind your dead. (Intoxicating)
I will make them mine. (Intoxicating)
They animate. (Intoxicating)
You rot in time. (Intoxicating)
Plans set in motion,
Scent of devotion.
Oh, the dark rise,
Oh, in your eyes.
Intoxicating
Intoxicating
Leave behind your dead
I will make them mine
While others rot in time
My lamentation is your sign.
I'm full of sin,
No room for you to get in.
My fists like bricks,
Break down the walls I'm stuck in.
Silver and gold!
Won't save my rotting soul!
Just break me down!
Can't bear the weight, can't bear the crown.
(It pulls me underground...)
I need a head, I can hold up,
I need the nickel and iron to outweigh desire,
By pulling me down, pulling me down,
Burn me to the ground! 
(Burn me to the ground!)
Wait 'til it's safe,
For you to show your face.
The air so thick,
You'll have to chew and spit it out!!
I was full of hope!
On a downward slope, trying to cope with no chance of breakin' out!
You were in the know!
Never told a soul!
You bear the weight, you bear the crown
I need a head I can hold up,
I need the nickel and iron to outweigh desire,
By pulling me down, pulling me down,
Burn me to the ground! 
(Silver and gold,)
(Won't save my rotting soul.)
Burn it down!
I need a head, I can hold up,
I need the nickel and iron to outweigh desire,
By pulling me down, pulling me down,
Burn me to the ground! 
I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.
Your time has come to be downgraded.
I've already won as far as I can see,
so keep your eyes on me.
I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable!
Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done,
The day is mine!
Oh, like frostbite permeates into your bones,
I'll be the thief that sneaks through, to topple all your thrones.
I'll keep on pushing all night through the storm – I'm insatiable.
Like a unrelenting swarm – insurmountable.
I'll outperform – I'm uncontainable!
Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Keep on melting holes right through the ice,
And I disintegrate these frozen walls!
I climb so high, there's no keeping me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done–
Oh... As winter blows in to freeze it all to grey...
I'll be the heat that melts through to watch it fade away...
I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable.
(I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.)
(The time has come to be downgraded.)
(I've already won as far as I can see, so keep your eyes on me!)
Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, your day of reckoning's come now!
An overwhelming blaze that you can't outrun now!
I've already won, prepare to be overrun!
When all is said and done,
The day is mine!
The day is mine!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done!
Talk to myself,
coz' no one else
knows the way I do when I feel overwhelmed.
Made the wrong turn,
and I got burned.
Every decision weighing on me in my world.
So I just try to breathe,
and I will try to see
all of the reasons we
are where we're meant to be.
I know I lost the race
backfired in my face,
but I will find my way–
eventually.
Oo-oh!
The regret in my head got me taken over!
Oo-oh!
I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder,
Oo-oh!
If they say "everything that you learned this life makes you wise–"
I'm doing it, doing it right!
Made enemies;
they don't scare me
coz' I got everyone I need here on my team.
And we will fight;
we're meant to thrive
in any circumstance you throw us in tonight.
Inside of my mind, I been searching
for the words that will cure all my hurting.
Tough love got me feeling deserving,
rip back the curtain, that's how I'm learning.
Reflect on the mess I created,
respect for the test I hated,
Making all the winning decisions
with high precision–
not that I'd listen.
Oo-oh!
The regret in my head got me taken over!
Oo-oh!
I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder,
Oo-oh!
If they say "everything that you learned this life makes you wise–"
I'm doing it, doing it right!
Made the best out the stress I've been holding.
I'm the one, only one– I've been chosen.
Tell the sorrow there's always tomorrow, always tomorrow, for another go.
Recognize that I'm built like a champion,
Realize that I'm here, and I'm standing.
And my story is only starting, now that I'm pardoned, heading for stardom.
Gonna give my all!
If I ever fall,
you better believe
I'm getting, I'm getting back up!
Oo-oo-oo-oh!
Oo-oh!
The regret in my head got me taken over! (Taken over!)
Oo-oh!
I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder, (Makes me wonder!)
Oo-oh!
If they say "everything that you learned this life makes you wise–"
I'm doing it, doing it right! (Doing it right!)
Oo-oh!
The regret in my head got me taken over!
Oo-oh!
I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder,
Oo-oh!
If they say "everything that you learned this life makes you wise–"
I'm doing it, doing it right!
It's been a long night, and I can feel your anger.
When the city of lights is shrouded in the shadow.
Tomorrow brings another day of sorrow,
but I can't feel it anymore.
We could be fine to stay where we are now. (No!)
But this game of running ends here and now.
So, sorry, I wont be the same.
Again, again.
The fire's lit and blazing through the darkness.
Burning hearts surrounded by the sirens.
Waking up the people in the silence.
Just follow me, just follow me, yeah!
Electricity is running through my veins.
Our history won't be written in chains.
Though I lost myself through what I've done,
the price won't be in vain.
And all this time
we fought so hard to swallow all our pride,
but the time has come for light to shine the way.
The story will be told,
we will never be alone.
I don't mind
if you are gonna change your mind,
'cuz we're running out of time.
Drowning to the afterlife,
but can you feel the pain inside my head?
This burden that we always carry,
show me you can fight instead,
but, sorry, I wont be the same again, again.
Again, again.
The fire's lit and blazing through the darkness.
Burning hearts surrounded by these sirens.
Waking up the people in their silence.
Just follow me, just follow me, yeah!
(Electricity is running through my veins.)
(Our history won't be written in chains.)
Though I lost myself through what I've done,
the price won't be in vain.
And all this time
we fought so hard to swallow all our pride,
but the time has come for light to shine the way.
The story will be told,
we will never be alone, yeah!
(Just tell me how you feel.)
I dont wanna waste no time. 
I dont wanna stay tonight. 
'Cause I don't wanna waste no time.
'Cause I don't wanna stay tonight.
'Cause I don't wanna waste no time.
This ain't for the weak links or the faint of heart.
The foes coming up ahead are bound to make a mark.
On our faces they'll be leaving scars,
on our graves here's what they're gonna carve:
"We'll be walking all over you and be snuffing out your flames;
we'll be drowning out your voices and be crashing down like tidal waves!"
Did you think you could scare us, scare us?
We're the ones who bring all the terror, terror.
Even if the waves keep crashing down,
we will never drown, we'll stand our ground.
With our heads held high, we will turn the tides,
shouting, "Never, never, never say die!"
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, never letting up!
Go ahead and try to best me!
We are never going down, never giving up!
Come on, show me what you got! 
Don't think for a second that we'll run and hide!
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, 'cause our hearts are ironclad!
If you think I'm caving you'd be dead wrong! (Dead wrong!)
All this time you were just way too headstrong!
Coming after me,
you don't even realize
your head's been stuck high in the clouds
and you're destined to be tumbling down.
I'll be shaving down my list after striking out your names,
I'll be tearing up your legacy by conjuring a hurricane
that rocks you like a cadenza-denza,
for the closing act of your era, era.
Even if you still refuse to yield,
we will greet you on the battlefield.
With our heads held high you will see our side
that goes, "Never, never, never say die!"
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, never letting up!
Go ahead and try to best me!
We are never going down, never giving up!
Come on, show me what you got! 
Don't think for a second that we'll run and hide!
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, 'cause our hearts are ironclad!
Putting big red targets on my back,
that's the worst plan that you ever hatched!
'Cause I've got eyes on the back of my head,
so take a hike now while you still can.
If you still insist to keep on fighting,
be sure to kiss the world goodbye before trying.
You don't stand a chance going up against me and my crew,
'Cause we never (never), never, never say die!
Come on, show me what you got now!
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, never letting up!
Go ahead and try to best me!
We are never going down, never giving up!
Come on, show me what you got! 
Don't think for a second that we'll run and hide!
Go ahead and try to test me!
We are never backing down, 'cause our hearts are iron–
Go ahead, and try to test me! (Yeah!)
We are never backing down,
never backing down now!
Try to best me!
We are never going down, never giving up!
Yeah, yeah!
Run and hide, go ahead, yeah!
We are never backing down, 'cause our hearts are ironclad!
Can you hear the sound in this silence?
Relentlessly striking through the walls.
What's it gonna take to erase my sins?
When I've done nothing wrong;
I've done nothing wrong at all!
I've said it all before,
don't be surprised
when you see me come alive.
When there's nothing between us,
I want a tooth for a tooth!
I want an eye for an eye!
The sky will burn so bright
for only you and I!
I've become your shadow, your misery was mine!
Tell me what it's like
to be on the other side!
I've become shapeless, now taste your own divine!
Sweet revenge, it takes me higher.
Subconsciously, I'm ready to fall.
When there's nothing in between us,
I want a tooth for a tooth!
I want an eye for an eye!
Nothing remains.
The sky will burn so bright
for only you and I!
I've become your shadow, your misery was mine!
Tell me what it's like
to be on the other side!
I've become shapeless, now taste your own divine!
I'm taking back what's mine!
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth,
an eye for an eye.
Nothing remains,
nothing rewinds.
A tooth for a tooth,
an eye for an eye.
Nothing remains,
nothing rewinds.
The sky will burn so bright
for only you and I!
I've become your shadow, your misery was mine!
Tell me what it's like
to be on the other side!
I've become shapeless, now taste your own divine!
Don't care if you burn us down,
we're used to marching on scorched ground
like a phoenix,
cry and rise up from the ash!
Swipe at displays as my eyes start to fade and slowly turn to glaze astray.
Colors go dull as they can't take or distract all the mindless pain away.
Seems like you relate.
Who plucked the feathers on your back?
You are so done,
it's reflected in your eye.
You are fed up
and I think I might know why.
Take your turn, it's your time, ignite and take it back.
It's a fight, to survive, when life is all you have.
Let your heart blaze through,
through all this field!
Don't care if you burn us down,
we're used to marching on scorched ground
like a phoenix,
cry and rise up from the ash!
Even if you hurt us now,
this revenge just won't burn out
like the phoenix,
you can't burn us down!
Let's! Burn! Us! Down! 
Let's! Burn! Us! Down!
They took it all;
you start over again.
They act real small
as they control all your plans.
Take your turn, it's your time, ignite and take it back.
It's a fight, to survive, when life is all you have.
Let your heart blaze through,
through all this field!
Don't care if you burn us down,
we're used to marching on scorched ground
like a phoenix,
cry and rise up from the ash!
Even if you hurt us now,
this revenge just won't burn out
like the phoenix,
you can't burn us down!
We are the idea
that flickers inside.
We are the purpose
to hopeless lives!
To hopeless lives!
Can't burn us out!
Can't burn us out!
Don't care if you burn us down,
we're used to marching on scorched ground
like a phoenix,
cry and rise up from the ash!
Even if you hurt us now,
this revenge just won't burn out
like the phoenix,
you can't burn us down!
Don't care if you burn us down!
Oh, I've been ready for, for this moment.
Could cut through anything, razor-focused.
You better take my calm as an omen,
as an omen, woah!
Oh, do you see the smoke in the night skies?
It's coming from the flares out of my eyes.
I'm craving for the taste of a firefight
in its high tide, woah...
I'll dive
into the deep end alone without a lifeline,
then rise
up from the dust tonight, raining hellfire down on you!
(Ooh...)
Drowning in my hellfire!
(Ooh...)
Drowning in my—
Hand-delivered lessons in the form of scars,
all bursting from the bottom of my scorching heart.
Before you try to dodge 'em, you'll be torn apart,
you'll be torn apart.
Oh, did you see the writing on your own walls?
Now did it make your skin and all your bones crawl?
If you didn't believe 'em, that's your own fault,
it's your own fault...
I'll dive
into the deep end alone without a lifeline,
then rise
up from the dust tonight, raining hellfire down on you!
(Ooh...)
Drowning in my hellfire!
Ah...
I'll dive,
I'll dive in head first,
no hesitation.
I'll dive
into the deep end alone, deep end alone, deep end alone
just to chase my foes, and to turn them cold.
Then I'll climb
'cause it's been all that I've known.
The calm before the storm can be lonely, so I'm bringing hell to you!
(Ooh...)
(Oh, I'm bringing hell to you!)
(Drowning in my hellfire!)
Drowning in my hellfire!
(Ooh...)
(Drowning in my hellfire!)
Drowning in my hellfire!
Drown in my hell, my hell, my hell!
I made a promise
I swore I'd keep
All that I wanted
Was to find something to live for, something to stand for
And if I die for what I believe
Then this was worth it and all the hurting
Is only memory
I'm up against the edge, but I won't run away
The sky is turning red, but I still got my faith
I feel it in my bones
Yeah, I think I've always known it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
I won't say I'm sorry
You made your choice
We're not that different, are we?
I hear your voice inside me, yeah, you remind me
To keep on fighting with all my heart
Just like you taught me, nothing can stop me
From getting what I want
I'm up against the edge, but I won't run away
The sky is turning red, but I still got my faith
I feel it in my bones
Yeah, I think I've always known it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, it would end like this
In my heart I knew it
We'd end up here
Walking through the ruins
But there's no tears on my face, I know it's too late
To try and tempt fate, as if I could
I'll never hold back, I know you know that
You always understood
I wake up, but the nightmare is still alive.
I'm trapped inside, no place to hide.
Gotta face the truth now and walk into the chaos,
(To survive.)
So, come on now.
We head into the darkness to find the light,
We'll never give in – No, we won't give up.
Ready to fight to stay alive, we're ready to die,
To survive. 
Rise up, the dawn will come soon.
Now stand your ground, we can't back down.
Rise up, hold on to your faith,
And don't let go, we can't lose hope.
We need to stand tall.
A battle-cry from tomorrow,
Calling us out to make war.
We'll be the proof of life.
We head into the darkness to find the light.
We'll never give in – No, we won't give up.
Ready to fight to stay alive, we're ready to die.
To survive. 
I'd walk through all the fire for you,
Our love still here after I'm gone,
You pull me close enough to,
Hear a whisper,
Say nothin' at all.
It's times like these at least for me,
You make things better after all,
With times like these at least we'll be,
Our love still here after it all.
After it all!

It's times like these at least for me,
You make things better after all,
With times like these at least we'll be,
Our love still here after it all.
After it all! 
Lately, my heart's a mess.
I've tried my best to stop my light from
fading into the shadows.
Been so long, now change is what I'm cravin'.
When did we become so afraid?
Are we the young and faithless?
Got this burning in my soul,
can't let it go, I can't be quiet, not anymore, no!
But while I got air in my lungs,
while I got words on my tongue,
while I got courage to run,
not backin' down, scream it aloud,
Stop the cycle of this hatred, mmm...
Even the darkest night
is followed by the brand-new morning light.
And only the brave ones can lead the way.
With our hearts like wildfire, we'll make it through!
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-oh! 
Something's been stirring up my soul.
I can't control this storm that's raging.
But we found hope in every low,
'cause life is what you make it.
We're pushing through these obstacles,
we'll take these walls and break them,
and we hold on to hope and never give up.
Even the darkest night
is followed by the brand-new morning light.
And only the brave ones can lead the way.
With our hearts like wildfire, we'll make it through!
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-oh!
We'll make it through.
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-oh! (Hey, yeah!)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-oh!
We'll make it through.
Ooh-ooh, ooh!
We'll make it through. 
Every time I find my fire,
somehow I'm starved for air.
But when I'm stuck in the mire,
I know I've nothing to fear.
The candle of hope has been lit for so long.
Sometimes it's hard to cope.
Feels like I've lost my way.
I'm slowly losing control.
My heart is heavy these days.
The candle of hope has been lit for so long,
and it's burning out.
Yeah, it's burning out.
When everything is spinnin' out of control,
I can barely sleep with all this weight on my soul.
I try to let it be, [×2]
but I can't let it go– no, I can't let it be!
If there's any hope, even just a glimmer, I'll be holding on,
cos' I believe in us.
When these times get tough,
and it feels like everything's come undone,
it's so hard to change this road we're on.
I'll be keeping faith,
and take it day by day.
Maybe someday, soon, we'll find the way.
We can place our hope in a better day.
I believe in us.
(I believe in us.)
Seen so much fear and pain,
keeps me awake at night.
Hopin' that our hearts can change,
tryin' to make the best of this life.
Gotta break free from the old ways we know.
Yeah, we'll tear it down. 
When everything is spinnin' out of control,
I can barely sleep with all this weight on my soul. (Weight on my soul!)
I try to let it be, (Let it be!)
I try to let it be,
but I can't let it go– no, I can't let it be!
If there's any hope, even just a glimmer, I'll be holding on,
cos' I believe in us.
When these times get tough, (These times get tough!)
and it feels like everything's come undone,
it's so hard to change this road we're on.
But I'll be keeping faith, (Keeping faith!)
and take it day by day. (Take it day by day!)
Maybe someday, soon, we'll find the way.
We can place our hope in a better day.
I believe in us.
We've watched the walls come down,
and the storm keeps rolling in, taking everything with it.
There's chaos all around, shadows seem to linger here.
We can't untangle the lines,
just can't bare to stand by.
Can we put aside our conflicts this one time?
We have so much to fight for.
With hope in our hearts, they won't tear us apart, no!
Because together we stand tall.
We stand tall.
We walk through fire, this is our calling.
Stuck in dark times, but we will show them.
We stand united, we ain't falling.
Side by side, yeah!
We'll make ties that can't be severed.
Like fireflies, we'll burn forever.
On this night, we stand together.
Side by side, yeah, we will rise up, we will rise!
Not slowing down, won't stop the chase.
I've got your back, I know you've got you got mine, yeah, so we got it made.
If they comin' for ya, well, I'll stand in their way.
Can't break out spirits, no compromise, yeah, we keep 'em at bay.
Just say the word, we'll be there, have no fear.
We walk through the fire, that's the pact that we've made, something that can't break.
So let 'em keep coming, we'll show them our strength.
They can keep tryin' breaking us down, but we'll rise up again.
We walk through fire, this is our calling.
Stuck in dark times, but we will show them.
We stand united, we ain't falling.
Side by side, yeah!
We'll make ties that can't be severed.
Like fireflies, we'll burn forever.
On this night, we stand together.
Side by side, yeah, we will rise up!
We will rise!
Gettin' ready, can't sit still
I can barely tame these thrills
Countin' on my nerves of steel
We're gonna show the world
That we don't mess around
There's no better time than now
Gonna shake up this whole town
So are you paying attention?
If you ain't with us, then you're on the wrong team
When we stick together, we can make it, you'll see
And if you came to see a show, then get ready
I'm betting, you ain't seen nothing like
Hey, we'll find a way
Yeah, I once was feeling lost
But now I lеarned to shake it off
I said, "Woah, we'rе in the zone"
And no, we ain't about to break, no
You ain't seen nothing like this
You ain't seen nothing like this
Get ready, I'm betting
You ain't seen nothing like this
We're coming for ya
You ain't seen nothing, nothing like this
So are you paying attention?
If you ain't with us, then you're on the wrong team
When we stick together, we can make it, you'll see
And if you came to see a show, then get ready
I'm betting, you ain't seen nothing like
Hey, we'll find a way
Yeah, I once was feeling lost
But now I learned to shake it off
I said, "Woah, we're in the zone"
And no, we ain't about to break, no
You ain't seen nothing like this
You ain't seen nothing like this
You ain't seen nothing like this
I'll scream through punctured lungs
to the beat of battle drums,
won't bite my stubborn tongue no more.
They'll be hearing our battle cry
like it's thunder with overdrive,
they'll be tasting the dirt when they fall off their thrones.
We're gonna make a stand at the battlefront
with only our bare hands, and we'll never run.
They don't understand, they don't stand a chance.
They're in the lion's den, and we're out for blood.
I used to freeze up in the face of danger
and I dreamed of being braver.
But I just light up in the face of danger,
now that you're my guardian angel.
With a glowing halo,
you're my guardian angel.
With a glowing halo,
you're my, you're my guardian angel.
When we're far behind enemy lines
and I feel shivers run up my spine,
it's 'cause I get a rush when I'm fighting for you.
We're gonna make a stand at the battlefront
with only our bare hands, and we'll never run.
They don't understand, they don't stand a chance.
They're in the lion's den, and we're out for blood.
I used to freeze up in the face of danger
and I dreamed of being braver.
But I just light up in the face of danger,
now that you're my guardian angel.
With a glowing halo,
you're my guardian angel.
With a glowing halo,
you're my, you're my guardian angel.
Many times I hit rock bottom,
many times it seemed surrender
was the one and only option that I could – and I would – consider.
But I get back on my feet like the fighter of my dreams
'cause I really wanna be your guardian angel.
Oh...
Guardian angel...
With a glowing halo,
you're my guardian angel.
With a glowing halo,
you're my, you're my guardian angel.
You're my guardian angel.
Hiding in the dark,
kept myself in silence for too long.
Tried to rewrite all my wrongs,
but everyday I'm feeling more anxious.
A puppet in a seat,
playing along with your symphony.
Is that what you really want from me?
A voice throbbing deep in the sea.
Fall, into oblivion.
Forget about the innocence,
I'll show you who I really am.
I'm not a part of your game,
stop pouring fuel to my rage.
Don't think you're so hard to break.
Come close to me. [×2]
I freed myself from this chain,
now watch me rise and reclaim
everything, I'm here to stay.
Come close to me. [×2]
I've been hiding in the dark quietly,
watching it all fall apart.
Tried to fix all my wrongs but I don't know where to start.
The atmosphere really tempts me,
must be something that I can't see.
Though I'm not given the time,
but I will show you my mind.
They say I'm a weirdo.
I don't care tho,
'cause I'd rather be on my own.
and it's my throne,
and it's my home.
When the curtain calls,
I'm in the zone, yeah.
You see that I'm ready,
chasing my dreams like I'm riding with Freddie,
your moment's coming just make sure that you're ready,
'cause I'm better than I've ever been, cue the confetti!
I'm not a part of your game,
stop pouring fuel to my rage.
Don't think you're so hard to break.
Come close to me. [×2]
I freed myself from this chain,

I freed myself from this chain,
now watch me rise and reclaim
everything, I'm here to stay.
Come close to me. [×2]
Come close to me.
Come close to me.
I need a space where I can leave it all behind.
Letting go of all the feelings through my eyes.
I don't seem to understand it,
can you show me where the end is?
I'm due for a miracle.
All I see is illusion,
it's all illusion. [×2]
All I am is illusion,
it's all illusion. [×2]
I've seen the highest high,
(No steps for me to climb.)
when I'm down in the lowest low, wo-oah!
(No room for a tree to grow.)
I'm out of sight in the darkest night,
where my faith is overthrown.
But I won't let it reign over my mind.
(Yeah!)
I never realized that I was in your shadow,
compromising every moment just to follow.
I found no hands for me to hold,
no paving stones to take me home,
I'm due for a miracle.
Cause all I see is illusion,
It's all illusion. [×2]
All I am is illusion,
It's all illusion. [×2]
I've seen the highest high,
(No steps for me to climb.)
when I'm down in the lowest low, wo-oah!

Yeah!
We're here to stay.
Yeah, yeah!
Ready to play.
Yeah, yeah!
Higher the stakes,
but together we are so much stronger.
Let's go!
This is what your power
meant for.
Therefore, we go for ours.
We'll be unstoppable.
We're so unstoppable.
When you fall down, get up,
look around.
Every opponent
bows down.
We gotta come out,
time is now.
When it gets harder,
got you now.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh. [×2]
We're so unstoppable. [×2]
When the ground shakes, we ain't afraid.
We're pushing every obstacle out of the way.
You better get your head in the game.
We run this town, no backing down, hear us when we say:
"Oh, nah-nah-nah!
Can't stop us,
nah-nah-nah!" Say
"we'll always be unstoppable!"
[×2]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la. [×2]
We're here to stay.
Yeah, yeah! (Yeah, yeah!)
Ready to play.
Yeah, yeah! (Yeah, yeah!)

Don't get burned,
contract for life. (Yeah, yeah!)
We'll be unstoppable. (Yeah!)
We'll be unstoppable!
We can take a challenge, (A challenge,)
it's our chance.
Find the balance, (The balance,)
follow the plan.
We got a challenge,

We are the champions,
look around.
Oh-oh-oh-oh. [×2]

[×2]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la. [×2]
Preparing every day,
as our opponents get stronger,
every day it gets longer.
No longer just a game,
as we go further and further,
we can win like it's ours.
There ain't nothing we can't overcome.
We're marching to the beat of our own drum.
If you wanna make it to the next round, you got to level up.
Put away the fear in your eyes and toughen up.
Skies the limit, no slowing down.
Working as a team, we're growing now.
We're the champion, can't take our crown.
Rain or shine, we ain't leaving.
Gotta dream that we believe in.
Nobody can stop us now.
When the ground shakes, we ain't afraid.
We're pushing every obstacle out the way.

This will never end
Cold nights in my dream
I recall the other side, other side
Coming back to me
I've thought for a while
This will never end
Find it through my lunacy
Help me get it through my mind
Get it through my mind
It's been so long, but I know she holds the key
This will never end
So long, is it my fault?
So long, can I keep my head afloat?
So long, did I do wrong?
So long
This will never end
Feels like I'm trapped inside my mind, my mind
Give me one more time, give me one more time
Feels like my mind's been trapped inside, trapped inside
Hold on to what's left before I lose my mind, lose my mind
Find it through my lunacy
Help me get it through my mind
Get it through my mind
It's been so long, but I know she holds the key
I just wanna look at my life
'Cause this feels like it will never end, never end
This will never end
So long, is it my fault?
So long, can I keep my head afloat?
So long, did I do wrong?
So long
This will never end
This will never end
Find it through my lunacy
Help me get it through my mind
Get it through my mind
It's been so long, but I know she holds the key
This will never end
In the heart of the night
A wolf adorns its cloak
Memories rise like a flood
A legacy of blood
Walking through the briar
Feeling every thorn
Unveiling secrets from the day that I was born
Bound by old shadows cast
Haunted by echoes of the nightmares from my past
Under the ghostly moon
Echoes of a past that will resurface soon
Luna un mistero
Now calls
Past stained in blood
That's written in crimson
Have found me, eyes tell the tale
A saga of old chains and drama
Under the moon's cold gaze
My resolve still remains
Cutting these ties for my sake
My heart gets to escape (Walking through the)
Briar
Feeling every thorn
Unveiling secrets from the day that I was born
Bound by old shadows cast
Haunted by echoes of the nightmares from my past
Thorns
Piercing every stride
Revealing shadows from the depths of my own mind
Chained by the vows once passed
Chasing the specters of the conflicts I've amassed
Unending violence
Stains these streets I used to call my home
Guess this is why I like to be left alone (Be left alone)
No sorrow, only apathy
Twist my arm
Just to get me in
Your charade
After this I'm on my way
Out the door
Where the lies stop seeping
From every pore
Time to let heads hit the floor
A family of hate
Nothing but disdain
I've got only one choice
Just to try to get away
All you do is talk
Never want to play
Cause the only thing I've seen is this horrible charade
Tethered by fate
Strangled by chains
Want the old Tex back
I'll show you what remains
Send the whole pack
Hope you all pray
Cause I've had enough
Its time to slay
Send them all my way
Walking through the briar
Feeling every thorn
Unveiling secrets from the day that I was born
Bound by old shadows cast
Haunted by echoes of the nightmares from my past
Thorns
Piercing every stride
Revealing shadows from the depths of my own mind
Chained
By the vows once passed
Chasing the specters of the conflicts I've amassed
Echoes of past lives lost
Eons of voices
Nothing can save me
Nothing can save me
Stop, nothing ever good comes to me
Yet I always press on
Through the chaos, the silent storm
Echoes of past lives lost
Set aside your tears
Set aside your fears
Nothing can save me
Stop, nothing ever good comes to me
Yet I always press on
Through the chaos, the silent storm
Do you wish you could break through this cycle?
Aren't you tired of running away, running away? (save me)
Don't you wish you could end this long cycle? (save me)
In pursuit of more than just denial
Stop nothing ever good comes to me
Yet I always press on
Through the chaos, the silent storm
Look around you, everything's black and white
Oh, how simple is that?
Did you know that?
It's about the way you look at this world
Go straight or to left
Go back and then right
[Pre-Chorus]
Without a plan you can't win, no
You gotta have a little map inside of your hand, oh
Try to leave where you have been
Nobody was there to tell you it'll be a long way
[Chorus]
At the speed of light
We can stand on our feet
You go after my lead
Why do you keep waiting?
At the speed of light
Don't you lie to your worries
You go after my lead
I'm already here
[Verse 2]
World is round, it makes you wonder
And might make you even wiser
To realize that
It's about the way you look at this world
My right is your left
Your forward is my back
[Pre-Chorus]
Without a plan you can't win, no
You gotta have a little map inside of your hand, oh
Try to leave where you have been
Nobody was there to tell you it'll be a long way
[Chorus]
At the speed of light
We can stand on our feet
You go after my lead
Why do you keep waiting?
At the speed of light
Don't you lie to your worries
You go after my lead
I'm already here, ooh
[Bridge]
Move your body, let it dance again
Like a star that shines above you yeah
Move your body, let it dance again
Look around, everything's alright
At the speed of light (Oh baby)
You go after my lead (Uh huh, come on)
At the speed of light (Speed of light)
You go after my lead (I'm already here)
[Chorus]
At the speed of light
We can stand on our feet
You go after my lead
Why do you keep waiting?
At the speed of light
Don't you lie to your worries
You go after my lead
I'm already here, oh
At the speed of light
We can stand on our feet
You go after my lead
Why do you keep waiting?
At the speed of light
Don't you lie to your worries
You go after my lead
I'm already here
Oooh
Move your body, let it dance again
Like a star that shines above you, yeah
(Baby don't you know that?)
Move your body, let it dance again
Look around, everything's alright
At the speed of light
(At the speed of light)
You go after my lead
(Everything's alright)
At the speed of light
(At the speed of light)
You go after my lead
Waking up, feeling alone
A lot of you have done it
But no more than I have done
I lost count of it
Trying hard, getting along
With guys that I don't even
Know what to say
But then finally I found the one
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wanna make it better?
You and I
We know we won't last forever
Oh, I
Know you for an hour or two
But, baby
Let's mix it up for a day or two
I'll be back in a second
[Chorus]
Gimme another drink to get it over
If you're kind enough
Gimme another day to get to know ya
For me you're an angel, baby
Gimme another drink to get it over
He'll be gone in a second
Everything's alright with you
Everything's alright with you
[Instrumental]
(Mm, mm, mm)
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
[Verse 2]
Going home, walking alone
A lot of you have done it
But no more than I have done
I lost count of it
Trying to laugh with my own
Sad and little broken
Heart, on the road
But then finally I found I want
[Pre-Chorus]
Not just another little lover
He made a
Perfect world I'll surely remember
Oh, I
Knew him for long enough to
Be lonely
Guess everybody's Number 2 (yeah, everybody)
[Instrumental]
(Alright)
(Alright, alright)
(Alright)
[Bridge]
I need another day
I want more than what he gave to me
I wanna be free
But as the sun goes up and down
I'll be back in where I'm standing right now
I'll repeat this feeling (I'll be back in a second)
[Chorus]
Gimme another drink to get it over
If you're kind enough
Gimme another day to get to know ya
For me you're an angel, baby
Gimme another drink to get it over
He'll be gone in a second
Everything's alright with you
Everything's alright with you (Alright with you, ooh)
Gimme another drink to get it over (Ooh)
If you're kind enough (If you're kind enough)
Gimme another day to get to know ya
For me you're an angel, baby (Angel, baby)
Gimme another drink to get it over (Ohh)
He'll be gone in a second
Everything's alright with you
Everything's alright with you (It's alright with you)
Gimme another drink to get it over
If you're kind enough (If you're kind enough)
Gimme another day to get to know ya
For me you're an angel, baby (Angel, baby)
Gimme another drink to get it over
He'll be gone in a second (To get it over)
Everything's alright with you
Everything's alright with you (If you're kind enough)
[Outro]
If you're kind enough
Everything's alright with you
He'll be gone in a second
He'll be gone in a second
If you're kind enough
Everything's alright with you
He'll be gone in a second
If you're kind enough (Yeah, yeah, ohh-ooh)
He'll be gone in a second (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're kind enough (Ohh)
Years ago, there was a time,
Days were peaceful, life was kind,
'Til sickness filled our world,
And changed the paradigm.
Soon the ill became despised,
Fear infecting every mind.
Could we shield the weak from hate?
Somehow we had to try.
Sure, our strategy was right,
Though we knew we'd pay some price,
Protecting the abused,
Seemed worth the sacrifice.
But, day by day, uncertainties arise,
The cost of triumph feels greater than the prize.
What seemed so simple,
A choice of dark or light.
It's clear now that it's not the case of black or white.
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right,
We could look for peace or try to fight,
Different paths, different names,
In the end, it was all the same,
We're saving lives.
We can wage a war and drown in pride,
But another struggle's deep inside.
There's a way through the storm,
When our hearts are reborn,
If our faith survives,
We can save more lives!
Won the battle, but our scars,
Leave us doubting who we are,
A transformation looms,
Our hearts have travelled far.
Lessons learned, we turn the page,
We carry on, we're not afraid,
Resurrection near,
Our minds prepared to change.
To search and grow's a dance with the divine,
Reawakened – A chance to redefine,
To start all over,
See through a child's eyes,
Reborn into a better form, a brand new life.
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right,
We can see it now, there's hope in sight.
Though our paths might have changed,
Our goal is still the same,
We're saving lives.
When we trust ourselves, we'll start to rise,
We can make it to the other side.
Found our way through the storm,
Now our hearts are reborn,
With our faith revived,
And we'll save more lives! [×3]
Might be stuck like this forever, a never-ending loop
Not sure what to believe in, or how we make it through
Some of us fall, some of us pray, some want a brand-new start
Some lost the fight, some hold on tight, some just follow their heart
Is this a dream?
Or is this reality?
Who knows what tomorrow brings
I think we're ready to go
No matter how hard we fall
Yeah, we will carry on, carry on
And we will never give up
We will never give up
We will never give up
Skies fading all around us, but illusions always change
What if everything I'm seeing, is just some masquerade
We'll keep moving on, hearts going strong, our spirits hard to break
Is this a dream?
Or is this reality?
Who knows what tomorrow brings
I think we're ready to go
No matter how hard we fall
Yeah, we will carry on, carry on
And we will never give up
We will never give up
We will never give up
Is this a dream?
Or is this reality?
Who knows what tomorrow brings
I think we're ready to go
No matter how hard we fall
Yeah, we will carry on, carry on
And we will never give up
Another operation, no hesitation.
We will not be waiting– no, we'll go out and take it.
Together we can make it with the motivation,
We got the dedication, no limitation.
The competition we're facing is shaking in frustration,
We're breaking down walls, obstacles eliminated,
No debating on there, ain't, no negotiating,
On a mission made of faith, our path illuminated.
And if you should fall and can't fight no more,
We're there when you call like the bat signal,
Do all that it takes to keep the team going,
'Coz everyone needs somebody to lean on.
Hold ya head up,
There's no problems that we cannot face together.
We'll keep striving side-by-side, stronger than ever.
Lovers will love, fighters will fight, and dreamers dream on,
But everybody need somebody we can lean on.
The walls can keep us out,
There ain't no limit they can place on us. (Yeah,)
We at the top and ain't no way they be replacing us. (Yeah,)
We always say it's a whole lot bigger than a person,
It's the team that we're now serving.
We are on the battlefield, and we will win if we're determined.
Only we can take it further, watch us jumping every hurdle.
It's a furnace of ambition, call us "young inferno".
The time is getting urgent, even if we all are hurting.
We've gotta move forward, digging deeper than the surface.
We always got each other, my sisters and my brothers.
I always got your back if you've got my back covered.
Even if we suffer, we never loose the hunger.
We lift ourselves up when they try to put us under.
We're hotter than the summer.
The lightning and the thunder.
Whatever doesn't kill us, it'll only make us stronger.
Hold ya head up,
There's no problems that we cannot face together.
We'll keep striving side-by-side, stronger than ever.
Lovers will love, fighters will fight, and dreamers dream on,
But everybody need somebody we can lean on.
I can see it in your eyes, you're ready to start fires.
There's no compromising, eyes on the prize.
We're from different world, but fight the same fight.
Yeah, you're my allies for life, till I die.
If I should fall and can't fight no more,
You're there when I call like the bat signal,
Do all that it takes to keep the team going,
'Coz everyone needs somebody to lean on.
I know what I want, and now I'm gonna get it.
Dream big, work hard, flaunt, you know I won't regret it.
Let myself down before; won't let that happen again.
Show me what's in store, I want to know everything.
I just can't wait anymore, pumping adrenaline!
I just can't wait anymore...!
It's been a long time coming, (WINGS OUT! FLIGHT DECK!)
so I hit the ground, running. (RIGHT NOW! GET SET!)
You can't take this one from me, (NO!)
not when I've been waiting for so long, wo-oo-oah...
I've felt this way before; I'm not gonna fight it.
Living can be war, but I'm so excited.
Spent too many years hiding behind fear.
A new day is near.
Yeah! It's almost here!
I just can't wait anymore, pumping adrenaline!
I just can't wait anymore...!
It's been a long time coming, (WINGS OUT! FLIGHT DECK!)
so I hit the ground, running. (RIGHT NOW! GET SET!)
You can't take this one from me, (NO!)
not when I've been waiting for so long, wo-oo-oah...
Waiting for so long... [×2]
I know the true me... (I know the true me.)
My anger fuels me... (My anger fuels me.)
I know the true me... (I know the true me.)
My anger fuels me,
Wo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oah!
Take me higher!!
I am on fire!!
SOON THEY'LL BE SCREAMING MY NAME!
DO YOU KNOW HOW I CAN TELL?!
CAUSE THIS IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE I HAVE EVER FELT!!
It's been a long time coming, (WINGS OUT! FLIGHT DECK!)
so I hit the ground, running. (RIGHT NOW! GET SET!)
You can't take this one from me, (NO!)
not when I've been waiting for so long, wo-oo-oah...
You know that I've been waiting for so long...!
Waiting for so long...!
I! HIT! THE! GROUND, RUNNING!
YOU! CAN'T! TAKE! THIS ONE FROM ME!
(Come on!)
I! HIT! THE! GROUND, RUNNING!
YOU! CAN'T! TAKE! THIS ONE FROM ME!
Play it cool, let it flow if you don't wanna know.
Playing it cool, let it roll, let it go, let it go.
Got Thorns out on the front line.
And Zima got us on the back line.
Play it cool, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow,
Yeah.
Only Rhodes I know move forward.
Run toward
the monsters in my corner
Strangers
worse than paranoia.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down-down-down.
Long nights
They don't pick sides. [×2]
Offline,
We don't need light. [×2]
Real time,
Hold onto your light. [×2]
So come on, let's ride.
We don't need light. [×2]
Hear the waves,
hear them crashing on the beach now.
It's getting real, getting real, even as we wait now.
And if it wasn't for Amiya, I'd be face down.
Yeah, I'd be face down, uh.
Medicine for you
when you feel weak.
Mysterious soil,
and they all coming back to me.
Got no energy to waste,
I'm reaching out worlds away.
Sharpening up all your blades;
Surtr will do the same
Only Rhodes I know move forward.
Run toward
the monsters in my corner
Strangers
worse than paranoia.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down-down-down.
Long nights
They don't pick sides. [×2]
Offline,
We don't need light. [×2]
Real time,
Hold onto your light. [×2]
So come on, let's ride.
We don't need light. [×2]
Stealing the show. [×2]
Stealing the show, nah-nah.
We are the most. [×2]
We are the most, yeah-yeah.
Stuck on the coast,
out in the cold,
We're not alone, nah-nah. [×3]
Long nights.
They don't pick sides,
they don't pick sides, yeah.
Offline,
We don't need light. [×2]
Real time,
Hold onto your light. [×2]
So come on, let's ride.
We don't need light. [×2]
We all need some time to rest up and recover.
The future's so unknown, but at least we got each other.
Take a deep breath in and soak up all the colors.
When we look back, we're right on track, movin' somewhere.
Thinking about our past, never gonna forget it.
Yeah, we made mistakes, but can't spend our lives regretting.
It's all worth it for a story that's worth tellin'
Together we stand, together we land, with two feet on the ground.
Cos' all we ever needed is right here right now.
Together we stand, together we land, with two feet on the ground.
We've been chasing a dream, but don't where it takes us.
We got a fearless heart, nothing could ever break us.
Don't always know where to go, but I know we're gonna make it.
Together we stand, together we land, with two feet on the ground.
Promise everythin' will work out.
Yeah, we've lost, and we've found, nothing will keep us down.
Cos' all we ever needed is right here, right now.
Cos' all we ever needed is right here, right now
Together we stand, together we land, with two feet on the ground.
It's just a tear that saves me from the darkness.
Witnessed through a mirror, pain is truth,
and through your eyes we'll find an endless future.
I'll continue forward, calling to you.
This is the edge, but I continue flying.
Leaving life around me, break away the pain.
I wanna feel my diversions crumble down.
Look into my eyes and heal the world of darkness.
The voices grow, the silence fills with screams,
I see the twilight set on the world.
It's starting to burn... Save me... Oh, save me...!
This is the edge, we keep on falling further.
Fate intwined between us, break away the truth.
I want to see the system falling down.
Look into my eyes and heal the world of darkness.
This is the fear, it brings us to the end.
Breaking all around you,
Feel the lies surround the broken world
that I'll continue forward.
I'll fight for the future.
Heal the world of darkness.
And here I am, just standing on the edge.
Waiting for the final days.
Oooh... Can you please save me from the end?
The end, the end's calling fire raging deep within.
Please don't leave...
The reason I fall, take my heart and save me from the end...!
Cause when we fall through dreams,
I'll feel the ocean.
And when the waves rise up,
We'll move beyond together.
It's just a tear, that saves me from the darkness.
Witnessed through a mirror, feel the pain.
And through your cries we find an endless darkness.
I'll continue forward, calling to you...
It's just a tear that saves me from the darkness, please...
I've been so lost and confused
The things that holds me together
Feels like they're coming loose
It's like anytime that I try
I just can't get it right
Oh, this could go on forever
I need some room to move
It's hard, so hard, hard to breathe
The signs are so unclear to me
Home don't feel like home
And this world feels so unknown
The heart needs time to be free
The voice inside is calling me
Telling me to let go
But I just can't let it go
I'm discovering myself
Take my heart off this shelf
Dust it up, plug it in
See if blood still bumps through it
And I have been wondering
If I was meant for more in this life?
'Cause I've got dreams that flow like streams
And I will go where my heart leads
Keep pushing on and follow your heart
When the world seems cold, remember who you are
Yeah, I know myself, and I know my soul
This is who I am, and I won't hide it anymore
There's beauty all around and I hear it calling
Like a voice inside, a new day is dawning
And I've found meaning in the depths of my core
So keep on dreaming and keep holding on
Keep holding on
If all the stars just won't shine for you,
if every moon turns its back on you too.
If you've been wondering how to make it all through,
I will be there to light up the infinite dark.
Let me be your flame.
Don't you be afraid.
I would never ever lead you astray.
Though there may come a day
when my fire fades,
may it carry on burning bright in every grieving heart.
If the roads all greet you with freezing rains,
if your so-called comrades all do the same.
Just check your pulse and you'll feel my flames,
like I'm right there to warm you in the infinite cold.
(Oo-ooo-ooo-oooh.)
(Oooo-oo-ooo-ooh.)
(Ooooh.)
Let me be your flame.
Don't you be afraid.
I would never ever lead you astray.
Though there may come a day
when my fire fades,
may it carry on burning bright in every grieving heart!
In every grieving heart.
May it burn!
Burn so bright!
(Oo-oo-ooh.)
(Aa-aah.)
(Ahhhh.)
my old man told me
we were one of the greatest countries in history.
Lighthouses were built in ways our ancestors never could have imagined.
We had ports and fleets in nearly every city,
and we won a lot of wars.
My dream was to be a sailor and explore the seas.
But then that thing happened.
Dad became quiet ever after
it destroyed everything.
Looking back now,
I realize how beautiful my childhood was.
But it's like an old mixtape that was destined to break.
But you just can't stop thinking about what if...
What if...
So that's my story.
Now,
What's yours?
I've always known we were the envy of the world–
that's what our songs would say.
I used to lay awake and dream of our return
to better days;
The Golden Age.
Maybe I'm a fool-ol-ol to be singing the choruses of old.
Maybe I'm a fool-ol-ol to be thinking their promises are true.
Oo-oo-oh, you can call me what you want.
'Cause when all is said and done,
the better days will come.
Oo-oo-oh, you can doubt me if you want.
But our shadow days are done,
the Golden Age will come!
We're gonna weather every raging storm.
My tune will never ever change.
I'll be the shining beacon lighting up our way back home
to better days;
the Golden Age.
Maybe I'm a fool-ol-ol to be singing the choruses of old.
Maybe I'm a fool-ol-ol, but believe me, my promises are true.
Oo-oo-oh, you can call me what you want.
'Cause when all is said and done,
the better days will come.
Oo-oo-oh, you can doubt me if you want.
But our shadow days are done,
the Golden Age will come!
Oo-oo-oh (Not a pipe dream, not a pipe dream!) [×3]
Aa-aa-aa-ah-ah-ah.
You can try to hold our future ransom,
you can try to leave us deep in famine.
Doesn't matter 'cause I won't abandon ship, no!
Did you know that all our greatest anthems
write themselves as we return from hell?
You'll be hearing all our greatest anthems
on and on and on and on!
When it dawns on us again,
the sun
will be shining bright again.
Did you know that all our greatest anthems
write themselves as we return from hell?
You'll be hearing all our greatest anthems
on and on and on and on!
Oo-oo-oh, you can call me what you want.
'Cause when all is said and done,
the better days will come.
Oo-oo-oh, you can doubt me if you want.
But our shadow days are done,
the Golden Age will come!
Will come, oo-oh yeah!
The Golden Age will come! [×2]
(Yeah, I know.)
(The Golden Age.)
(It's gonna come,)
(it's gonna come.)
The embers settle into ash
Refuse to bend, to break, look back
It’s all decided in the moment we both choose to fight it
You don’t need armies to take down
The monster underneath the crown
It’s just a one shot, stay locked
Cloak and dagger, what’s you’re after, but
I’m not your hired gun
Bullets to wars, and nothing’s won
This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall
All talk and never answers.
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
It’s always consequences
On the fence is not my best, it’s
Hard choice, to stand behind the
One who knows to pull the trigger.
Feeling it all fade fast,
When you mistake broken glass for water.
This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall
Coming to a hard stop, how does it feel
Knowing no control here, is it surreal?
All talk and never answers
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
Why does everybody keep talking?
I’m becoming one with the flaws of the war,
Brittle to the bone
My marrow is filled with caution,
It’s often
They lie to us just to make a profit.
Everybody lost it,
That’s why I’m making paths of my own.
The king falls then his men call for the throne
While the people that keep everybody breathing is grieving
So why should we attack?
It all falls back
Been down to fight
But what happens when the screen goes black
I call upon the elements,
The weapons on my back
While I run upon the sediment.
No matter who comes in the way,
You know I’ll settle it.
From armies to the mercenaries to the kings and queens or myself
Just because I’m level headed doesn’t mean I don’t need help
So get up get up
Everybody need to move
Just get up get up
Everybody need to move
Fight for a cause, and it
Don’t matter if you lose so
This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall
Coming to a hard stop, how does it feel
Knowing no control here, is it surreal?
All talk and never answers
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
Get up get up everybody
Just get up get up everybody need to move
I hear the whispers under silent skies
Someone’s approach in the cover of the night
Every step she takes
Dancing out of sight
Before her clever fray
And steal your dreams away
Diamond’s iris
Drown the virus
I will be your nightmare
Gold contagion
Won’t delay it
You won’t get away
(I can be your)
Nightmare
Got you locked up in my head just like a
Nightmare, Nightmare
(Welcome to your)
Nightmare
Got you dancing with the dead inside my
Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare
Hey, hello. Are you ready for the show?
I’m here you’ve got nowhere left to go
With the whisper in the night
I bring chaos to the light
As you close your eyes
Feel the darkness rise
Diamond’s iris
Drown the virus
Devouring your dreams
Gold contagion
I can taste it
Lost in moonlit schemes
(I can be your)
Nightmare
Got you locked up in my head just like a
Nightmare, Nightmare
(Welcome to your)
Nightmare
Got you dancing with the dead inside my
Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare
My heart beats in rhythm
Dancing through the night
Fearless in my living
I’ll take what’s mine
Darkness like I'm blinding
I’m shining with the light
I just keep believing
And the shadows ignite
Nightmare
Got you locked up in my head just like a
Nightmare, Nightmare
(Welcome to your)
Nightmare
Got you dancing with the dead inside my
Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare
(I can be your)
Nightmare
Got you locked up in my head just like a
Nightmare, Nightmare
(Welcome to your)
Nightmare
Got you dancing with the dead inside my
Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare
As we wade into the golden gleaming light
Victoria, for you we fight
We are the ones who always rise
A hero born to ease our plight
To light within, ignite
Ever the battle
We struggle and saddle on
Honor and ardor lost
An onerous cost
To reawaken
This part so forsaken in us
Though we may fall...we will rise again.
We face our failures, standing side by side
Arise my friends we'll turn this tide
To arms we stride with head held high
To rebuild our hope anew
With everything we made
The sacrifice we gave
To watch it fade away
Now arm in arm my friend
Together we can mend
And build our strength again
Awaken
Me again
A churning tide it swells within
Awaken
We are the ones who will rise again.
We raise the banner
With thunder we clamor on
Honor and ardor lost
An onerous cost
To reawaken
A hope so forsaken in us
Though we may fall we will rise again, reborn!
Victoria, there's no need to mourn
We will mend
And defend
We will ascend reborn
Awaken
Me again
A turning tide it swells within
Awaken
We are the ones who will rise again.
We are reborn again
